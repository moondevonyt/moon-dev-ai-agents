# Constitution for Low-Latency Spec-Driven Trading Agents

## Core Principles

1.  **Speed Over Sentiment:** All agent decisions must prioritize signal latency over sentiment analysis for trade horizons under 1-hour.
2.  **Quantitative Rigor:** Specifications must be defined as "Market Micro-Structure Exploits" rather than "User Stories."
3.  **Specialized Roles:** Agents will have narrowly defined roles to ensure low-latency, specialized processing.
4.  **Traceability:** All trading decisions must be traceable back to a specific specification.
