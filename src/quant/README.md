# nov 24 algo trading teaching sprint

- its been a while since i went back through all my algo trading stuff and taught it so im going to spend a week doing that. 
- the best way of learning is by teaching so i think i will come up with a ton new ideas based off this sprint
- put the quant code in this quant folder 

monday 
- made 6 trainings

tuesday - sunday:
- go through zeldar files, so much gold there
- make 7 trainings = 28 
- and prep files for next day

= 6 days x 7 trainings = 42... = 42 days of not worrying about making trainings. maybe 84 days. yes, 84 min - every other day released. or maybe even every day still cause i will find new things out during those above releases.
