# ai agents 

## build list 
[] solana copy trading agent 
    [x] get the copy bot live again
    [x] update the call to be from api.moondev.com to save a ton of time and be able to execute copy bot way way faster. 
    [] build out agent in order to view that api call 
    [] build out a DB of recent TXs for any tracked wallet we have or that has been put in the discord and constantly run then give access to everyone 
    [] have the scanned transaction tokens shown on a discord channel, with the api key and link + tutorial so everyone can access it
[] sentiment agent 
[] rbi agent 
[] solana sniper agent
    - Remember this year I am trying to replicate what I've done in the last four years with AI agents so I've had a lot of success with the Solana Sniper and the Copy Trading Agent as a somewhat of a scanner of new tokens on the market and new narratives that are bubbling up. So for the copy bot agent and also this sniper agent. I think I want to run the sniper and the copy bot and then let the agent look at that filter data opposed to just sending in all of the data to the agent, the LLMs that will get too messy, in my opinion. 
[] liquidation trading agent
[] open interest trading  agent
[] funding rate trading agent 
[] coin gecko agent - if i give a agent or swarm access to all of coingecko data from 2014, it will be able to cook no doubt.
    - i want these agents to look for high volume tokens that are not on major exchanges

[] listing arb agent - idea is to find freakishly high volume tokens that keep it up for a few days, or weeks that are not on binance or cb. 
    - current problem is that its a fuck ton of data i need to go through, like 15,000 tokens on coingecko 
    - i have birdeye and coin gecko, i can set up scanners that are looking for high volume tokens, no worries, its just time and api cost. 

    - possibly look thorugh recently added coins, they are fresh on coingecko 




## moon dev api is in early alpha testing to host data i've been collecting like liquidations, open interest, funding rates, new token launches on solana, solana "good" traders, & recent trades from those traders. apply for access as an alpha tester by posting in the #members_chat with what you're looking to build with the api.
