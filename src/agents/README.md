[x] sentiment agent 
[x] rbi agent 
[] solana sniper agent
    - Remember this year I am trying to replicate what I've done in the last four years with AI agents so I've had a lot of success with the Solana Sniper and the Copy Trading Agent as a somewhat of a scanner of new tokens on the market and new narratives that are bubbling up. So for the copy bot agent and also this sniper agent. I think I want to run the sniper and the copy bot and then let the agent look at that filter data opposed to just sending in all of the data to the agent, the LLMs that will get too messy, in my opinion. 
[x] liquidation trading agent
[x] open interest trading  agent
[x] funding rate trading agent 
[x] coin gecko agent - if i give a agent or swarm access to all of coingecko data from 2014, it will be able to cook no doubt.
    - i want these agents to look for high volume tokens that are not on major exchanges

[x] listing arb agent - idea is to find freakishly high volume tokens that keep it up for a few days, or weeks that are not on binance or cb. 
    - current problem is that its a fuck ton of data i need to go through, like 15,000 tokens on coingecko 
    - i have birdeye and coin gecko, i can set up scanners that are looking for high volume tokens, no worries, its just time and api cost. 

    - possibly look thorugh recently added coins, they are fresh on coingecko 

[] coin gecko agent ehancements, its a vast api so i wanna look thorugh it and come up with ideas
    - top gainers and losers could be cool to work off as a scanner: https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-top-gainers-losers
