STRATEGY_NAME: FibCloudTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibCloudTrend strategy combines Fibonacci Retracement levels with the Ichimoku Cloud to identify and follow strong trends while managing risk effectively. This approach leverages the confluence of Fibonacci support/resistance levels and the Ichimoku Cloud's dynamic zones to confirm trend direction and potential entry/exit points.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Used to identify potential support/resistance levels during pullbacks in a trend.
2. **Ichimoku Cloud**: Provides a comprehensive view of trend direction, momentum, and dynamic support/resistance.
   - **Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)**: Short-term trend indicator.
   - **Kijun-Sen (Base Line)**: Medium-term trend indicator.
   - **Senkou Span A/B (Cloud)**: Defines dynamic support/resistance zones.
   - **Chikou Span (Lagging Line)**: Confirms trend strength.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Trend Confirmation**:
   - Price must be above the Ichimoku Cloud for an uptrend or below the Cloud for a downtrend.
   - Chikou Span should be above/below price for confirmation.
2. **Pullback to Fibonacci Level**:
   - Wait for price to retrace to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) within the trend.
3. **Ichimoku Confirmation**:
   - Tenkan-Sen should cross above Kijun-Sen for a long entry or below for a short entry.
   - Price should bounce off the Fibonacci level and remain above/below the Cloud.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2%, 161.8%) as a target.
   - Alternatively, exit when price breaks below/above the Cloud.
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below/above the most recent swing low/high or below/above the Cloud.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the account per trade.
2. **Stop Loss Placement**:
   - Ensure the stop loss distance aligns with your risk tolerance.
3. **Trailing Stop**:
   - Use the Kijun-Sen or Cloud boundaries as a trailing stop to lock in profits.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - Draw from the most recent swing low to swing high (uptrend) or swing high to swing low (downtrend).
2. **Ichimoku Cloud**:
   - Default settings (9, 26, 52) are recommended.

### Example Setup:
- **Uptrend**:
  - Price is above the Ichimoku Cloud.
  - Price retraces to the 50% Fibonacci level.
  - Tenkan-Sen crosses above Kijun-Sen.
  - Enter long with a stop loss below the Cloud or swing low.
  - Target the 127.2% Fibonacci extension level.

- **Downtrend**:
  - Price is below the Ichimoku Cloud.
  - Price retraces to the 61.8% Fibonacci level.
  - Tenkan-Sen crosses below Kijun-Sen.
  - Enter short with a stop loss above the Cloud or swing high.
  - Target the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level.

This strategy is ideal for traders looking to capitalize on strong trends while using Fibonacci levels and the Ichimoku Cloud to manage risk and confirm entries.
