STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a mean-reversion strategy that capitalizes on divergences between the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicators. The strategy focuses on identifying overbought or oversold conditions and uses a combination of moving averages and oscillator crossovers to generate entry and exit signals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **RSI (20-period)**: Used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
2. **Stochastic Oscillator (8,20)**: Used to confirm momentum divergences.
3. **20-period Moving Average (MA)**: Acts as a filter for both RSI and Stochastic Oscillator signals.
4. **Price Targets**: Fixed exit points at $10 (for short trades) and $50 (for long trades).

### Entry Rules:
- **Short Entry**: 
  - RSI(20) > 20-period MA (indicating potential overbought conditions).
  - Stochastic Oscillator (8) < 20-period MA (confirming bearish momentum divergence).
- **Long Entry**: 
  - RSI(20) < 20-period MA (indicating potential oversold conditions).
  - Stochastic Oscillator (8) > 20-period MA (confirming bullish momentum divergence).

### Exit Rules:
- **Reversion Exit**: 
  - Exit when the Stochastic Oscillator and RSI revert to their respective moving averages (e.g., Stochastic Oscillator crosses above/below the 20-period MA or RSI crosses below/above the 20-period MA).
- **Price Target Exit**: 
  - Exit the trade if the price reaches the predefined targets ($10 for short trades, $50 for long trades).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2% of total account balance).
2. **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss based on recent support/resistance levels or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3% below/above entry price).
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio by adjusting position size and stop-loss levels.

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (20-period)**: To identify overbought/oversold conditions.
2. **Stochastic Oscillator (8,20)**: To confirm momentum divergences.
3. **20-period Moving Average (MA)**: To filter signals and act as a dynamic threshold.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in ranging or sideways markets where mean-reversion tendencies are stronger.
- Avoid using this strategy during strong trending markets, as divergences may persist longer than expected.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters and validate performance.
