STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityDivergence strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines MACD divergence, RSI divergence, and ATR-based volatility measurements to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy is particularly effective in volatile markets where price action and momentum indicators often diverge, signaling potential reversals or continuations.

Key Strategy Components:
1. MACD Divergence: The strategy focuses on identifying divergences between the MACD indicator and price action. A bullish divergence occurs when price makes a lower low while MACD makes a higher low. A bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high while MACD makes a lower high.

2. RSI Divergence: Confirms the MACD divergence by looking for similar patterns in the RSI indicator. This double confirmation increases the reliability of the signal.

3. ATR-Based Position Sizing: Uses the Average True Range (ATR) to determine position size and set stop-loss levels, adapting to current market volatility.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for both MACD and RSI to show divergence from price action in the same direction (both bullish or both bearish).
2. Confirm that the current ATR is above its 20-period moving average, indicating sufficient volatility.
3. Enter long positions on bullish divergence or short positions on bearish divergence.

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial stop-loss at 1.5x ATR from entry price.
2. Take profit at 2.5x ATR from entry price.
3. If price moves favorably by 1x ATR, move stop-loss to break-even.
4. Exit if MACD and RSI show convergence with price action, indicating the divergence trade is no longer valid.

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1% of account equity on any single trade.
2. Use ATR-based position sizing to ensure consistent risk across trades.
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 3% of account equity.
4. Maximum weekly loss limit of 5% of account equity.

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9)
2. RSI (14)
3. ATR (14)
4. 20-period moving average of ATR

Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in trending markets with moderate to high volatility.
- Avoid trading during low volatility periods when ATR is below its 20-period moving average.
- Consider using this strategy on liquid currency pairs or indices where volatility patterns are more reliable.
- Backtest thoroughly across different market conditions to understand its performance characteristics.
