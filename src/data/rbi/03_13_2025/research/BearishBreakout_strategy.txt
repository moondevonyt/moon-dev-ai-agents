STRATEGY_NAME: BearishBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BearishBreakout strategy focuses on identifying and trading high-probability breakout opportunities within bearish engulfing patterns. This strategy combines candlestick pattern recognition with breakout trading techniques to capitalize on potential downward price movements.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bearish Engulfing Pattern: A two-candle pattern where the second candle completely engulfs the body of the previous bullish candle, indicating potential reversal.
2. Breakout Confirmation: Price action breaking below the low of the engulfing pattern.
3. Volume Analysis: Increased volume during the breakout for confirmation.
4. Trend Context: The pattern should occur in an overall downtrend or after a significant upward retracement.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for a bearish engulfing pattern to form.
2. Enter a short position when price breaks below the low of the engulfing pattern.
3. Confirm the breakout with increased volume.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a stop-loss above the high of the engulfing pattern.
2. Take profit at a 1:2 risk-reward ratio or when price reaches significant support levels.
3. Exit if price closes back above the engulfing pattern low.

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of account capital per trade.
2. Use proper position sizing based on stop-loss distance.
3. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods.

Required Indicators:
1. Candlestick chart for pattern recognition
2. Volume indicator for breakout confirmation
3. Moving averages (optional) for trend context

Additional Considerations:
- Look for bearish engulfing patterns near key resistance levels for higher probability setups.
- Combine with other technical indicators like RSI or MACD for additional confirmation.
- Avoid trading this pattern in strong uptrends without clear reversal signals.
- Consider the overall market context and sector performance.

This strategy works best in trending markets and can be applied to various timeframes, though higher timeframes (4-hour and above) tend to provide more reliable signals. Always backtest and paper trade before applying this strategy to live markets.
