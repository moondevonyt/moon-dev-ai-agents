STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBandShift

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumBandShift strategy combines RSI-based momentum signals with Bollinger Band and moving average analysis to identify directional trades. It focuses on capturing momentum shifts while incorporating trend confirmation through moving averages and volatility bands.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **RSI Momentum Signal**: Uses a 5-period RSI to identify oversold conditions relative to recent price action.
2. **Price Action Low**: Compares the RSI level to the lowest price action low over the past 3 periods.
3. **Bollinger Band Confirmation**: Uses a 20-period Bollinger Band to assess volatility and trend direction.
4. **Moving Average Filter**: A 10-period moving average acts as a trend filter for short positions.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Trigger: 5-period RSI falls below the lowest price action low of the past 3 periods.
   - Confirmation: Price must be above the 10-period moving average (optional, for additional trend confirmation).
   - Action: Enter a long position.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Trigger: 10-period moving average is above a declining 20-period Bollinger Band.
   - Confirmation: Price must be below the 10-period moving average.
   - Action: Enter a short position.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit**:
   - Exit when the 5-period RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition).
   - Alternatively, exit when price closes below the 10-period moving average.

2. **Short Exit**:
   - Exit when the 10-period moving average crosses below the 20-period Bollinger Band.
   - Alternatively, exit when price closes above the 10-period moving average.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop Loss**:
   - Longs: Set a stop loss at the recent swing low or a fixed percentage below the entry price.
   - Shorts: Set a stop loss at the recent swing high or a fixed percentage above the entry price.
2. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of account equity per trade (e.g., 1-2%).
3. **Take Profit**: Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, or trail the stop loss using the 10-period moving average.

### Required Indicators:
1. **5-period RSI**: To identify momentum shifts and oversold conditions.
2. **10-period Moving Average**: To filter trades and confirm trends.
3. **20-period Bollinger Band**: To assess volatility and trend direction.
4. **Price Action Low Calculation**: To compare RSI levels with recent price lows.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear momentum shifts.
- Backtest on multiple timeframes to identify optimal settings for your trading style.
- Consider adding volume confirmation to filter out low-probability setups.
