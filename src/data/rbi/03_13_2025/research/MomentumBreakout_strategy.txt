STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumBreakout strategy is a momentum-based trading approach that focuses on identifying oversold conditions and breakout opportunities. It combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum analysis, a moving average for trend confirmation, and the Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop-loss placement.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **50-period RSI**: Used to identify oversold conditions (below 30) as a potential entry signal.
2. **20-period Moving Average (MA)**: Acts as a trailing exit level to capture profits during pullbacks.
3. **20% ATR Stop-Loss**: Provides a dynamic stop-loss level based on market volatility.

### Entry Rules:
- Enter a **long position** when:
  1. The 50-period RSI crosses below 30, indicating an oversold condition.
  2. The price breaks above a recent resistance level or shows strong upward momentum.

### Exit Rules:
- Exit the position when:
  1. The price pulls back to the 20-period moving average level, signaling a potential trend reversal or consolidation.
  2. The stop-loss level (20% ATR above the entry point) is hit, protecting against excessive losses.

### Risk Management:
- **Stop-Loss Placement**: Set the stop-loss at 20% of the 14-period ATR above the entry price. This ensures the stop-loss adapts to market volatility.
- **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of the account balance (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
- **No Overtrading**: Only take trades when the RSI condition and breakout criteria are met.

### Required Indicators:
1. **50-period RSI**: To identify oversold conditions.
2. **20-period Moving Average**: For exit signals.
3. **14-period ATR**: For dynamic stop-loss placement.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear momentum shifts.
- Avoid using it in highly volatile or choppy markets, as false breakouts may occur.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters (e.g., RSI period, ATR multiplier) for specific instruments and timeframes.

By combining momentum analysis with breakout signals and dynamic risk management, the MomentumBreakout strategy aims to capture strong upward moves while minimizing losses during pullbacks.
