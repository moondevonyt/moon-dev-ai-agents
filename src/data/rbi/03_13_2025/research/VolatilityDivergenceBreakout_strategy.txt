STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergenceBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

The Volatility Divergence Breakout Strategy is a technical analysis-based trading strategy that combines the principles of volatility, divergence, and breakout techniques to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on identifying divergences between price movements and volatility metrics, followed by breakouts above or below established resistance or support levels.

**Key Strategy Components:**

1. **Volatility Metrics:** The strategy uses historical volatility (HV) and absolute volatility (AV) to measure market uncertainty.
2. **Divergence Patterns:** The strategy looks for divergences between price movements and volatility metrics, specifically:
	* Bullish Divergence: Price makes a lower low, while HV or AV increases.
	* Bearish Divergence: Price makes a higher high, while HV or AV decreases.
3. **Breakout Levels:** Establish resistance or support levels using the 50-period moving average (MA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
4. **Risk Management:** The strategy uses a 2:1 risk-reward ratio to manage potential losses.

**Entry/Exit Rules:**

1. **Long Entry:** Buy when:
	* Price breaks above established resistance.
	* Bullish Divergence is confirmed with HV or AV increasing.
	* RSI reaches 30 (oversold condition).
2. **Short Entry:** Sell when:
	* Price breaks below established support.
	* Bearish Divergence is confirmed with HV or AV decreasing.
	* RSI reaches 70 (overbought condition).
3. **Exit Rules:**
	* Take profits when the trade reaches a 5% profit target.
	* Close positions if the trade reaches a 8% loss stop-loss.

**Required Indicators:**

1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Used to identify oversold or overbought conditions.
2. **Historical Volatility (HV):** Measures market uncertainty and volatility.
3. **Absolute Volatility (AV):** Measures absolute price fluctuations and market uncertainty.
4. **50-period Moving Average:** Establishes resistance or support levels.

**Additional Notes:**

1. The strategy requires a minimum trading period of 30 days to ensure adequate data for divergence pattern analysis.
2. Use a sufficient account size and risk management techniques to minimize potential losses.
3. Monitor the strategy's performance regularly and adjust parameters as needed to optimize results.
