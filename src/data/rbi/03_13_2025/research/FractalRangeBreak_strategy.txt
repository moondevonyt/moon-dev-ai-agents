STRATEGY_NAME: FractalRangeBreak

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalRangeBreak strategy combines dynamic range breakout principles with fractal-based support and resistance levels to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy is designed to capture breakouts while leveraging fractal analysis to confirm key levels and filter false signals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Dynamic Range Calculation**:
   - The range is calculated dynamically based on recent price action, typically using the Average True Range (ATR) or a percentage of the recent high/low.
   - The upper range boundary is set as the recent high plus the dynamic range value.
   - The lower range boundary is set as the recent low minus the dynamic range value.

2. **Fractal Support and Resistance**:
   - Fractals are used to identify significant support and resistance levels. A fractal is a five-candle pattern where the middle candle is the highest (for resistance) or lowest (for support).
   - These fractal levels act as confirmation points for breakouts, ensuring that the price has established meaningful levels before breaking out.

3. **Breakout Confirmation**:
   - A breakout is confirmed when the price closes above the upper range boundary (for a long entry) or below the lower range boundary (for a short entry).
   - The breakout must also align with a fractal level to ensure the move has structural significance.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Wait for the price to close above the upper range boundary.
   - Confirm that the breakout aligns with a fractal resistance level.
   - Enter a long position on the next candle's open.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Wait for the price to close below the lower range boundary.
   - Confirm that the breakout aligns with a fractal support level.
   - Enter a short position on the next candle's open.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a trailing stop based on the ATR or a fixed percentage/point target.
   - Alternatively, exit when the price reaches the next significant fractal level in the opposite direction.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the most recent fractal support level for long positions or above the most recent fractal resistance level for short positions.
   - Ensure the stop loss is within an acceptable risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Calculate position size based on the distance between the entry price and the stop loss level, ensuring that the maximum risk per trade does not exceed a predefined percentage of the account (e.g., 1-2%).

2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
   - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or higher to ensure profitability over the long term.

3. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Avoid trading during low volatility periods or when the range is too narrow, as this increases the likelihood of false breakouts.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Used to calculate the dynamic range and set stop-loss levels.

2. **Fractal Indicator**:
   - Identifies key support and resistance levels for breakout confirmation.

3. **Price Action**:
   - Monitor candlestick patterns and closing prices to confirm breakouts.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in trending markets with clear support and resistance levels.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily) to identify optimal settings for your trading style.
- Combine with additional filters, such as volume analysis or trend indicators (e.g., moving averages), to further refine entries and exits.

By combining dynamic range breakouts with fractal-based support and resistance, the FractalRangeBreak strategy provides a robust framework for capturing high-probability trades while minimizing false signals.
