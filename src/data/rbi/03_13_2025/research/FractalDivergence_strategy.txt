STRATEGY_NAME: FractalDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
FractalDivergence is a self-similar pattern recognition strategy that utilizes fractal analysis to identify price patterns and divergent movements from Fibonacci retracement levels.

Key Strategy Components:

1. **Fractal Analysis**: The strategy uses fractal geometry to identify self-similar patterns in the price data, allowing for the identification of potential trading opportunities.
2. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: The strategy enters trades when there is a divergence between the price action and Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating a potential reversal or continuation of the trend.
3. **Divergence Indicators**: The strategy uses divergent indicators to identify the points of divergence between the price action and Fibonacci retracement levels.

Entry/Exit Rules:

1. **Long Entry**: Enter a long position when:
	* A divergence occurs between the price action and Fibonacci retracement level (e.g., bearish divergence on a downward trend).
	* The fractal analysis indicates a potential reversal point.
2. **Short Entry**: Enter a short position when:
	* A divergence occurs between the price action and Fibonacci retracement level (e.g., bullish divergence on an upward trend).
	* The fractal analysis indicates a potential reversal point.
3. **Exit Rules**:
	* Close all positions when:
		+ The price action reverts to the original trend line.
		+ The fractal analysis indicates a return to normal pattern behavior.

Risk Management:

1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your account balance for each trade (e.g., 2%).
2. **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss at a predetermined distance from the entry price (e.g., 10% below entry price).
3. **Take-Profit**: Set a take-profit target at a predetermined price level above or below the entry price (e.g., 15% above entry price).

Required Indicators:

1. **Fibonacci Retracement Indicator**: A custom indicator that displays Fibonacci retracement levels on the chart.
2. **Fractal Analysis Tool**: A custom tool that analyzes the fractal geometry of the price data to identify self-similar patterns.
3. **Divergence Indicator**: A custom indicator that identifies divergent movements between the price action and Fibonacci retracement levels.

By combining fractal analysis with divergence indicators, FractalDivergence aims to identify potential trading opportunities based on self-similar price patterns and divergent movements from Fibonacci retracement levels.
