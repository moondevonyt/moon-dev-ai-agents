STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSurge Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumeSurge Breakout strategy is designed to capitalize on significant price movements following periods of oversold conditions, confirmed by a surge in trading volume. This strategy combines volume analysis with oscillator-based oversold signals to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Volume Analysis: Uses a volume-based indicator to detect unusual trading activity
2. Oversold Conditions: Identifies potential reversal points using an oscillator
3. Breakout Confirmation: Requires price to break above a key resistance level

Required Indicators:
1. Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA) - 20 period
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14 period
3. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period
4. Volume Spike Detector (custom indicator or 2x average volume)

Entry Rules:
1. RSI must be below 30 (oversold condition)
2. Volume must spike to at least 2x the 20-period average volume
3. Price must close above the 20-period VWMA
4. The breakout candle must have a range greater than 1.5x ATR

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: 2x ATR from entry point
2. Stop Loss: 1x ATR below entry point
3. Trailing Stop: Activate at 1x ATR profit, trail at 0.5x ATR

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of account equity per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Trade only during high liquidity hours (market open + first 2 hours)

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Use on liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups

The VolumeSurge Breakout strategy is particularly effective in capturing early momentum in reversals from oversold conditions, with the volume spike providing confirmation of institutional interest and potential trend continuation.
