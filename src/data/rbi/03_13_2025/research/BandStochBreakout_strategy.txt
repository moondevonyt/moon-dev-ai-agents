### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit:**
   - Use the opposite Bollinger Band as a target (e.g., for a long trade, target the lower band).
   - Alternatively, use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).

2. **Stop Loss:**
   - Place the stop loss just outside the breakout level (e.g., below the upper band for a long trade or above the lower band for a short trade).

3. **Stochastic Reversal:**
   - Exit if the Stochastic Oscillator reverses direction (e.g., crosses below 80 for a long trade or above 20 for a short trade).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:**
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your account per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between the entry price and stop loss.

2. **Avoid False Breakouts:**
   - Wait for a confirmed close above/below the Bollinger Band.
   - Ensure the Stochastic Oscillator confirms the breakout direction.

3. **Market Conditions:**
   - Best used in trending or range-bound markets.
   - Avoid using during high-impact news events or extreme volatility.
