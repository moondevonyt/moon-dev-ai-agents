STRATEGY_NAME: OvernightErod

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The OvernightErod strategy is a specialized approach designed to capitalize on overnight price movements while incorporating sector rotation analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on 60-minute highs during the overnight session (typically 6 PM to 6 AM EST)
- Utilizes the EROD (Earnings Relative to Outstanding Debt) ratio for sector rotation analysis
- Incorporates ATR (Average True Range) for dynamic stop-loss placement
- Targets specific sectors showing strength based on fundamental metrics

2. Entry Rules:
- Identify 60-minute highs during the overnight session
- Confirm sector strength using EROD ratio (higher ratio indicates stronger sector)
- Enter long positions when:
  a) Price breaks above the 60-minute high
  b) The sector shows an EROD ratio above its 20-day moving average
  c) Volume is at least 20% above the 10-day average

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: Take profit at 2:1 risk-reward ratio
- Secondary Exit: Close position if price falls below the 60-minute low
- Time-based Exit: Exit all positions before the market open (6 AM EST)

4. Risk Management:
- Set stop-loss at 5% below entry price
- Use ATR to confirm stop-loss placement (minimum 1.5x ATR)
- Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
- Maximum overnight exposure limited to 5% of total portfolio

5. Required Indicators:
- 60-minute high/low levels
- EROD ratio (sector-specific)
- 20-day moving average of EROD ratio
- ATR (14-period)
- Volume indicator (10-day average)

6. Additional Considerations:
- Monitor economic calendar for overnight news events
- Adjust position sizing during high-impact news periods
- Use sector ETFs for broader exposure when individual stocks show weak signals
- Regularly update EROD ratio calculations to reflect latest earnings and debt data

This strategy combines technical breakout patterns with fundamental sector analysis, making it particularly effective during periods of strong sector rotation. The overnight focus allows traders to capitalize on extended-hours movements while maintaining strict risk controls.
