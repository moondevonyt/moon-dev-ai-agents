STRATEGY_NAME: VolatileReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatileReversion strategy is a mean-reversion approach that combines RSI and MACD divergence signals with volatility-based exits using the VIX. This strategy is designed to capitalize on overextended price movements while managing risk during periods of heightened market volatility.

Key Components:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Used to identify overbought/oversold conditions
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Used to confirm divergence signals
3. VIX (Volatility Index) - Used as an exit signal during volatility spikes

Entry Rules:
1. Look for RSI to cross below 30 (oversold) or above 70 (overbought)
2. Confirm with MACD divergence:
   - For long entries: Price makes lower low while MACD makes higher low
   - For short entries: Price makes higher high while MACD makes lower high
3. Enter trade when both conditions align:
   - Long: RSI < 30 + bullish MACD divergence
   - Short: RSI > 70 + bearish MACD divergence

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: VIX spikes above its 20-period moving average by 15%
2. Secondary Exit: RSI returns to neutral zone (40 for long trades, 60 for short trades)
3. Stop Loss: 1.5x ATR (Average True Range) from entry point

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum portfolio exposure of 5% at any time
3. Daily loss limit of 3% across all positions
4. Weekly drawdown limit of 7%

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period)
2. MACD (12,26,9 settings)
3. VIX (with 20-period SMA)
4. ATR (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 4-hour or daily timeframes
- Works well in range-bound markets
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Combine with sector/industry analysis for better results
- Monitor correlation with broader market indices

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust RSI thresholds based on market conditions
- Experiment with different MACD settings for specific instruments
- Consider using VIX futures for more precise volatility measurements
- Implement a trailing stop after initial profit targets are hit

This strategy combines traditional mean-reversion techniques with modern volatility management, making it particularly effective in both trending and ranging markets while protecting against sudden market shocks.
