STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityArbitrage

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityArbitrage strategy is designed to exploit discrepancies between the implied volatility of stock options and the volatility index (VIX) futures. This strategy focuses on mean reversion opportunities by taking long positions in underperforming VIX futures and short positions in overperforming stock options.

Key Strategy Components:
1. **VIX Futures**: The strategy uses VIX futures as a proxy for market volatility expectations.
2. **Implied Volatility of Stock Options**: The implied volatility of individual stock options is compared to the VIX futures to identify discrepancies.
3. **Mean Reversion**: The strategy assumes that extreme discrepancies between VIX futures and stock option implied volatility will revert to the mean.

Entry Rules:
1. **Identify Discrepancy**: Monitor the implied volatility of stock options and compare it to the VIX futures. Look for situations where the implied volatility of stock options is significantly higher than the VIX futures.
2. **Long VIX Futures**: Take a long position in VIX futures when they are underperforming relative to the implied volatility of stock options.
3. **Short Stock Options**: Simultaneously, take a short position in the overperforming stock options to hedge and capitalize on the expected mean reversion.

Exit Rules:
1. **Mean Reversion Completion**: Exit the positions when the discrepancy between the VIX futures and the implied volatility of stock options has reverted to a more normalized level.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Implement a stop-loss mechanism to limit losses if the discrepancy continues to widen instead of reverting.

Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Allocate capital proportionally to the size of the discrepancy, ensuring that no single trade exposes the portfolio to excessive risk.
2. **Diversification**: Spread the strategy across multiple stocks and sectors to reduce the impact of any single stock's volatility on the overall portfolio.
3. **Stop-Loss Orders**: Use stop-loss orders to manage downside risk and protect against adverse movements.

Required Indicators:
1. **VIX Futures**: To track market volatility expectations.
2. **Implied Volatility of Stock Options**: To compare against VIX futures and identify discrepancies.
3. **Mean Reversion Indicators**: Tools to identify when the discrepancy is likely to revert to the mean.

This strategy requires a deep understanding of volatility markets and the ability to quickly act on discrepancies. It is suitable for traders with experience in options and futures markets.
