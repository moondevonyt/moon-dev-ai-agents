STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumCrossReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumCrossReversal strategy is a momentum-based reversal system that identifies potential trend reversals by analyzing the relationship between three key moving averages. The strategy focuses on capturing shifts in momentum when the difference between a 50-period moving average (MA) and a 200-period MA crosses above a 20-period exponential moving average (EMA). This unique combination of moving averages helps filter out noise and provides a clear signal for potential trend reversals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **50-Period Moving Average (MA):** Represents the medium-term trend.
2. **200-Period Moving Average (MA):** Represents the long-term trend.
3. **20-Period Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Acts as a dynamic threshold for momentum shifts.
4. **Momentum Reversal Signal:** The difference between the 50-period MA and 200-period MA crossing above the 20-period EMA.

### Entry Rules:
- **Long Entry:** Enter a long position when the difference between the 50-period MA and 200-period MA crosses above the 20-period EMA. This indicates a potential reversal in momentum favoring an upward trend.
- **Confirmation:** Wait for the price to close above the 20-period EMA to confirm the signal.

### Exit Rules:
- **Take Profit:** Set a take-profit level based on a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop-loss order below the most recent swing low or below the 20-period EMA, whichever is closer.
- **Trailing Stop:** Optionally, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trend continues.

### Risk Management:
- **Position Sizing:** Use a fixed percentage of the trading capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
- **Stop Loss:** Ensure the stop-loss level is placed at a logical support level to minimize losses.
- **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 2:1 to ensure profitability over time.

### Required Indicators:
1. **50-Period Simple Moving Average (MA):** To identify the medium-term trend.
2. **200-Period Simple Moving Average (MA):** To identify the long-term trend.
3. **20-Period Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** To act as a dynamic threshold for momentum shifts.

### Additional Notes:
- **Timeframe:** This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise and false signals.
- **Market Conditions:** Ideal for trending markets or markets transitioning from a downtrend to an uptrend.
- **Backtesting:** Always backtest the strategy on historical data to validate its effectiveness before applying it to live trading.

The MomentumCrossReversal strategy is designed to capture early momentum shifts while minimizing false signals, making it a robust tool for traders looking to capitalize on trend reversals.
