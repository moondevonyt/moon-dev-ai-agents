STRATEGY_NAME: TrendBandRSI

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
TrendBandRSI is a trading strategy that combines the strengths of trend following with band-based breakout detection using RSI (Relative Strength Index). This strategy is designed to capitalize on trending markets while limiting exposure to sideways or range-bound conditions.

**Key Strategy Components:**

1. **Rising/ Falling Trend**: The strategy enters trades when the RSI crosses above/below its upper/lower Bollinger Band, respectively, during a strong trend. This indicates that the price is breaking through the bands, indicating increasing/sDecreasing momentum.
2. **Band-Based Breakout Detection**: The use of Bollinger Bands provides a clear indication of overbought/oversold conditions, allowing for more precise entry and exit points.
3. **Trend Confirmation**: To ensure that the trade is entering a strong trend, additional filters can be applied to confirm the trend direction.

**Entry Rules:**

1. **Long Entry**: Enter long trades when the RSI crosses above its upper Bollinger Band during an uptrend.
2. **Short Entry**: Enter short trades when the RSI crosses below its lower Bollinger Band during a downtrend.
3. **Confirming Trend**: Use additional indicators, such as a 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) or a trend line, to confirm that the trend is strong and in the desired direction.

**Exit Rules:**

1. **Price Reversion**: Exit trades when the price reverts back to the original level of support/resistance.
2. **Bollinger Band Re-Alignment**: If the Bollinger Bands realign with each other, it can be a sign that the trend is weakening, and trades should be exited.

**Risk Management:**

1. **Position Sizing**: Use position sizing techniques, such as the 2% rule or a fixed amount of capital per trade.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss order at a reasonable distance from the entry price to limit potential losses.
3. **Take-Profit**: Set a take-profit target at a reasonable distance from the exit price to lock in profits.

**Required Indicators:**

1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Used for band-based breakout detection and trend confirmation.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: Used for band-based breakout detection and trend identification.
3. **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** or a **Trend Line**: Optional indicators used to confirm the trend direction.

By combining trend following with band-based breakout detection, TrendBandRSI offers a unique approach to trading that capitalizes on trending markets while limiting exposure to sideways or range-bound conditions.
