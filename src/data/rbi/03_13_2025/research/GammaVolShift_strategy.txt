STRATEGY_NAME: GammaVolShift

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The GammaVolShift strategy is a volatility-focused trading approach that combines gamma hedging dynamics with VIX-based market sentiment analysis. It aims to capitalize on mean-reversion in implied volatility by identifying stocks with high gamma hedge ratios during periods of low market volatility.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Gamma Hedge Ratio: Focuses on stocks with a gamma hedge ratio >1.2, indicating significant options market activity and potential for rapid price movements.
2. VIX Analysis: Utilizes the VIX index (<20) to identify periods of market complacency and low implied volatility.
3. Volatility Mean-Reversion: Anticipates a shift from low to higher volatility regimes, benefiting from the associated price movements.

Entry Rules:
1. Identify stocks with a gamma hedge ratio >1.2
2. Confirm VIX is below 20, indicating low market volatility
3. Enter long positions in selected stocks

Exit Rules:
1. Close positions when VIX rises above 25, indicating increased market volatility
2. Implement a trailing stop-loss at 5% below the entry price
3. Exit if gamma hedge ratio falls below 0.8, signaling reduced options activity

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on portfolio risk tolerance (1-2% per trade)
2. Diversify across multiple high gamma stocks
3. Use stop-loss orders to limit downside risk
4. Monitor VIX daily for potential market regime changes

Required Indicators:
1. Gamma Hedge Ratio (real-time options data)
2. VIX Index (CBOE Volatility Index)
3. Implied Volatility (IV) for selected stocks
4. Price charts with volume indicators

Additional Considerations:
- Focus on liquid stocks with high options trading volume
- Monitor earnings calendars to avoid unexpected volatility events
- Consider using options strategies to hedge positions
- Regularly review and adjust the gamma hedge ratio threshold based on market conditions

This strategy is particularly effective during periods of market stability transitioning to increased volatility, allowing traders to benefit from both the gamma effect and volatility expansion.
