STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveSynergy

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The AdaptiveSynergy strategy is designed to leverage unique combinations of technical indicators to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on the synergy between multiple indicators, ensuring that trades are only taken when multiple signals align, thereby increasing the likelihood of success.

Key Strategy Components:
1. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Helps in identifying overbought or oversold conditions.
3. **Bollinger Bands**: Provides insights into volatility and potential price breakouts.
4. **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**: Used to confirm the strength of the trend based on volume.

Entry Rules:
1. **MACD Crossover**: Enter a long position when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicating bullish momentum.
2. **RSI Confirmation**: Ensure that the RSI is above 50 but not in the overbought zone (above 70) for a long position.
3. **Bollinger Band Breakout**: Confirm the entry with a price breakout above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential upward momentum.
4. **VWAP Confirmation**: The price should be above the VWAP, confirming the strength of the bullish trend.

Exit Rules:
1. **MACD Reversal**: Exit the position when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, indicating a potential reversal.
2. **RSI Overbought**: Exit if the RSI enters the overbought zone (above 70), suggesting a possible pullback.
3. **Bollinger Band Reversion**: Exit if the price reverts back inside the Bollinger Bands, indicating a loss of momentum.
4. **VWAP Break**: Exit if the price falls below the VWAP, signaling a weakening trend.

Risk Management:
1. **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss at 1.5 times the Average True Range (ATR) below the entry price for long positions.
2. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the total trading capital on any single trade.
3. **Take-Profit**: Set a take-profit level at 2 times the ATR above the entry price to ensure a favorable risk-reward ratio.

Required Indicators:
1. **MACD**: For momentum and trend direction.
2. **RSI**: For overbought/oversold conditions.
3. **Bollinger Bands**: For volatility and breakout confirmation.
4. **VWAP**: For trend strength confirmation.
5. **ATR**: For setting stop-loss and take-profit levels.

The AdaptiveSynergy strategy is a robust approach that combines multiple indicators to filter out low-probability trades and focus on high-conviction setups. By ensuring that multiple indicators align before entering a trade, this strategy aims to maximize the probability of success while minimizing risk.
