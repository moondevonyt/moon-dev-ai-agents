STRATEGY_NAME: FibroDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroDivergence strategy combines RSI divergence analysis with Fibonacci retracement levels and ATR-based exits to identify high-probability reversal trades. This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets where price retraces to key Fibonacci levels while showing divergence between price action and RSI.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **RSI Divergence**: 
   - Use a 14-period RSI to identify divergence between price action and momentum.
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows.
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs.

2. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**:
   - Apply Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to the most recent significant swing high and low.
   - Focus on trades where price is retracing to one of these key levels.

3. **ATR (Average True Range)**:
   - Use a 14-period ATR to determine exit points based on multiples of volatility.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - Price must be at or near a key Fibonacci retracement level (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).
   - RSI must show bullish divergence (price lower lows, RSI higher lows).
   - Enter a long position when price starts moving upward after the divergence confirmation.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - Price must be at or near a key Fibonacci retracement level.
   - RSI must show bearish divergence (price higher highs, RSI lower highs).
   - Enter a short position when price starts moving downward after the divergence confirmation.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use ATR multiples to set take-profit levels.
   - For long trades, set take profit at 1x, 2x, or 3x ATR above the entry price.
   - For short trades, set take profit at 1x, 2x, or 3x ATR below the entry price.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below the recent swing low for long trades or above the recent swing high for short trades.
   - Alternatively, use 1x ATR below/above the entry price for tighter risk management.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop-loss levels.

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only take trades where the RSI divergence is clear and confirmed by price action.
   - Avoid trading during low-volume periods or when price is consolidating.

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (14-period)**:
   - Used to identify divergence between price and momentum.

2. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - Applied to the most recent significant swing high and low.

3. **ATR (14-period)**:
   - Used to determine exit levels based on volatility.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear swing highs and lows.
- Always wait for confirmation of the divergence before entering a trade.
- Combine this strategy with higher timeframe analysis to improve accuracy.

By combining Fibonacci retracement levels, RSI divergence, and ATR-based exits, the FibroDivergence strategy provides a structured approach to trading reversals with clear risk management rules.
