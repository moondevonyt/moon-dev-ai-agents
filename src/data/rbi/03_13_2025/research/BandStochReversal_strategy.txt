STRATEGY_NAME: BandStoch Reversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandStoch Reversal strategy combines Bollinger Bands and the Stochastic Oscillator to identify potential market reversals. This approach leverages the volatility-based Bollinger Bands to detect overbought/oversold conditions and the Stochastic Oscillator to confirm momentum shifts. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):**
   - Upper Band: 20-period SMA + (2 * Standard Deviation)
   - Middle Band: 20-period SMA
   - Lower Band: 20-period SMA - (2 * Standard Deviation)
   - Bollinger Bands help identify overbought (price near upper band) and oversold (price near lower band) conditions.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator:**
   - %K: 14-period Stochastic %K (fast line)
   - %D: 3-period SMA of %K (slow line)
   - Overbought: Above 80
   - Oversold: Below 20
   - The Stochastic Oscillator confirms momentum shifts and divergence patterns.

### **Entry Rules**
1. **Long Entry:**
   - Price touches or crosses below the lower Bollinger Band (oversold condition).
   - Stochastic Oscillator is below 20 (oversold confirmation).
   - Stochastic %K crosses above %D (momentum shift to the upside).
   - Enter a long position when all three conditions are met.

2. **Short Entry:**
   - Price touches or crosses above the upper Bollinger Band (overbought condition).
   - Stochastic Oscillator is above 80 (overbought confirmation).
   - Stochastic %K crosses below %D (momentum shift to the downside).
   - Enter a short position when all three conditions are met.

---

### **Exit Rules**
1. **Long Exit:**
   - Price touches or crosses the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).
   - Stochastic Oscillator crosses below 80 (momentum weakening).
   - Exit the long position when either condition is met.

2. **Short Exit:**
   - Price touches or crosses the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).
   - Stochastic Oscillator crosses above 20 (momentum weakening).
   - Exit the short position when either condition is met.

### **Risk Management**
1. **Stop Loss:**
   - Long Position: Place stop loss slightly below the lower Bollinger Band.
   - Short Position: Place stop loss slightly above the upper Bollinger Band.
   - Adjust stop loss levels based on volatility (e.g., 1.5x the band width).

2. **Position Sizing:**
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - Use the distance between entry and stop loss to calculate position size.

3. **Take Profit:**
   - Set a take profit level at the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., upper band for long trades, lower band for short trades).
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on the middle Bollinger Band.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Bollinger Bands:**
   - Period: 20
   - Standard Deviation: 2
   - Applied to closing prices.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator:**
   - %K Period: 14
   - %D Period: 3
   - Smoothing: 3
   - Levels: 20 (oversold) and 80 (overbought).

### **Additional Notes**
- This strategy works best in ranging or mildly trending markets. Avoid using it during strong trending conditions, as Bollinger Bands can lead to false signals.
- Combine with price action confirmation (e.g., candlestick patterns) for higher accuracy.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to identify optimal settings for your trading style.

By combining Bollinger Bands and the Stochastic Oscillator, the BandStoch Reversal strategy provides a robust framework for identifying potential reversals with clear entry and exit rules.
