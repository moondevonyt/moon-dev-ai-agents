STRATEGY_NAME: RangeBoundPut

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The RangeBoundPut strategy is a systematic approach to selling put options on futures contracts that exhibit a strong bullish trend, as indicated by their position relative to the 200-period moving average. The strategy focuses on capitalizing on the mean-reverting tendencies of price action within a defined range, while managing risk through precise stop-loss and limit-up levels.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **200-Period Moving Average (MA):**  
   - The 200-period MA serves as a key indicator of the overall trend. Futures contracts must have closed above this MA consistently over the past month to qualify for the strategy.
   - This ensures the underlying asset is in a strong bullish phase, reducing the likelihood of sharp downward moves.

2. **Price Range Analysis:**  
   - The strategy focuses on assets that have demonstrated stability within a defined price range, as confirmed by their position relative to the 200-period MA.

3. **Option Selling:**  
   - Sell out-of-the-money (OTM) put options on qualifying futures contracts. This allows the trader to collect premium income while betting on the asset's continued strength.

4. **Stop-Loss and Limit-Up Levels:**  
   - **Stop-Loss:** Set at 20% below the current price action to protect against significant downside moves.  
   - **Limit-Up:** Set at 10% above the current price action to lock in profits if the price moves favorably.

### Entry Rules:
1. Identify futures contracts that have closed above their 200-period MA for at least the past 20 trading days (one month).
2. Confirm that the asset has shown stability within a defined range, with no extreme volatility or erratic price movements.
3. Sell OTM put options on the qualifying futures contracts.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Stop-Loss Exit:**  
   - Exit the position if the underlying asset's price drops to 20% below the current price action. This prevents excessive losses in case of a sudden reversal.
   
2. **Limit-Up Exit:**  
   - Exit the position if the underlying asset's price rises to 10% above the current price action. This locks in profits and avoids overexposure to potential reversals.

3. **Expiration Exit:**  
   - If neither the stop-loss nor limit-up levels are triggered, hold the position until the option expires, allowing the trader to retain the full premium collected.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Allocate no more than 2-5% of the trading capital to any single position to ensure diversification and reduce risk exposure.

2. **Stop-Loss Discipline:**  
   - Strictly adhere to the 20% stop-loss rule to prevent catastrophic losses.

3. **Premium Collection:**  
   - Focus on selling options with sufficient premium to justify the risk, ensuring a favorable risk-reward ratio.

### Required Indicators:
1. **200-Period Moving Average (MA):**  
   - Used to identify the overall trend and confirm the asset's bullish phase.

2. **Price Action Analysis:**  
   - Monitor the asset's price movements to ensure stability within the defined range.

3. **Option Pricing Tools:**  
   - Use tools to calculate the premium, delta, and implied volatility of the put options being sold.

### Summary:
The RangeBoundPut strategy is designed for traders who want to capitalize on the stability of bullish futures contracts while managing risk through defined stop-loss and limit-up levels. By focusing on assets above their 200-period MA and selling OTM put options, the strategy aims to generate consistent premium income with controlled risk exposure.
