STRATEGY_NAME: ReversalBandTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ReversalBandTrigger strategy is a sophisticated trend reversal approach that combines moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to identify potential long opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **50-period Moving Average (MA)**: Used to identify short-term price trends.
   - **200-period Moving Average (MA)**: Represents the long-term trend.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **20-day Bollinger Bands**: Tracks volatility and price extremes.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - A long position is triggered when the following conditions are met:
     1. The 50-period MA crosses **below** the 200-period MA (indicating a potential trend reversal).
     2. The short-term RSI (14-period) is **above 40** (confirming bullish momentum).
     3. The price has breached the **upper limit** of the 20-day Bollinger Bands (indicating a potential breakout or overextension).

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - Exit the long position when the RSI resets below 40, signaling a loss of bullish momentum.
   - Alternatively, consider exiting if the price closes below the 50-period MA, confirming a reversal of the short-term trend.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Set a stop-loss below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price.
   - Use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
   - Position sizing should be based on account risk tolerance (e.g., risking no more than 1-2% of the account per trade).

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
   - 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
   - 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI).
   - 20-day Bollinger Bands with 2 standard deviations.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - This strategy works best in trending or volatile markets where Bollinger Bands and moving averages can effectively identify reversals.
   - Backtest the strategy on historical data to ensure its effectiveness in your chosen market and timeframe.
   - Combine this strategy with fundamental analysis or other technical tools for higher confidence in trade setups.

By focusing on the convergence of moving averages, RSI momentum, and Bollinger Band breakouts, the ReversalBandTrigger strategy aims to capture early trend reversals with a high probability of success.
