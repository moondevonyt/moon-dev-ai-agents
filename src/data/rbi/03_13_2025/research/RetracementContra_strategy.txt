STRATEGY_NAME: RetracementContra

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
RetracementContra is a mean reversion strategy that combines the power of Fibonacci retracement levels with contracting ATR bands to capture profitable trades in an uptrend with decreasing volatility.

**Key Strategy Components:**

1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels:** Use Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%) to identify potential support and resistance areas.
2. **Contracting ATR Bands:** Calculate contracting ATR bands using a suitable time frame (e.g., 15-minute, 30-minute) to determine the upper and lower bounds of price movement.
3. **Uptrend with Decreasing Volatility:** Identify uptrends with decreasing volatility by checking for decreasing average true range values over time.

**Entry Rules:**

1. **Touch at Fibonacci Level:** When the price touches a Fibonacci retracement level during an uptrend, enter a long position if the trend indicator (e.g., MACD, RSI) is oversold.
2. **Volatility Contraction:** Ensure that the volatility contraction level has been breached, indicating decreasing volatility.

**Exit Rules:**

1. **Breakout:** Close all positions when the price breaks out of the contracting ATR bands, signaling a potential trend reversal.
2. **Maximum Drawdown:** Set a maximum drawdown limit (e.g., 20%) to prevent excessive losses.

**Risk Management:**

1. **Position Size:** Calculate position size based on the available capital and risk tolerance.
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place stop-loss orders at the previous high-low range to limit potential losses.
3. **Position Closing:** Close positions when the price breaks out of the contracting ATR bands or reaches the maximum drawdown limit.

**Required Indicators:**

1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool:** Use a Fibonacci retracement tool (e.g., NinjaTrader, TradingView) to calculate and display Fibonacci levels.
2. **Contracting ATR Indicator:** Calculate and display contracting ATR bands using an indicator like the ATR Band Filter or the Volatility Breakout System.
3. **Trend Indicators:** Use trend indicators like MACD or RSI to confirm oversold conditions during uptrends.

By combining Fibonacci retracement levels with contracting ATR bands, RetracementContra aims to capture profitable trades in an uptrend with decreasing volatility while managing risk through position sizing and stop-loss orders.
