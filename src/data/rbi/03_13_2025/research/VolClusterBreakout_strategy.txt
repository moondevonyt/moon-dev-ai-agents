STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolClusterBreakout strategy focuses on identifying potential liquidity breakouts by analyzing volume clusters and applying volatility filters. This approach combines volume analysis with volatility thresholds to pinpoint high-probability breakout opportunities.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volume Clusters**: Identify areas of high trading volume that indicate significant liquidity zones. These clusters often act as support or resistance levels.
2. **Volatility Filters**: Use volatility measures (e.g., ATR or standard deviation) to filter out low-volatility periods and focus on high-volatility environments where breakouts are more likely.
3. **Price Action Confirmation**: Wait for price to break through identified volume clusters with strong momentum.
4. **Timeframe Selection**: Focus on higher timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, or Daily) for more reliable signals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volume Cluster Identification**: 
   - Use a volume profile indicator to identify significant volume clusters (high-volume nodes).
   - Mark these clusters as potential breakout zones.
2. **Volatility Filter**:
   - Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) or standard deviation over a 14-period window.
   - Only consider breakouts when volatility is above a predefined threshold (e.g., ATR > 1.5x the average).
3. **Breakout Confirmation**:
   - Enter a long position when price breaks above a volume cluster with a strong bullish candle (e.g., close above the cluster and high volume).
   - Enter a short position when price breaks below a volume cluster with a strong bearish candle (e.g., close below the cluster and high volume).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a take profit level at the next significant volume cluster or a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss just below the breakout level for long positions or above the breakout level for short positions.
3. **Trailing Stop**:
   - Use a trailing stop based on ATR to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
2. **Volatility Adjustment**:
   - Adjust position size based on current volatility. Higher volatility may warrant smaller positions to account for larger price swings.
3. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or market. Spread risk across multiple instruments.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Volume Profile**: To identify volume clusters and significant liquidity zones.
2. **Average True Range (ATR)**: To measure volatility and set filters.
3. **Candlestick Patterns**: To confirm breakout strength (e.g., bullish/bearish engulfing, pin bars).
4. **Moving Average (Optional)**: Use a 50-period or 200-period MA to confirm the overall trend direction.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets or during periods of high volatility.
- Avoid trading during low-volume or choppy market conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple instruments and timeframes to optimize parameters (e.g., ATR threshold, volume cluster sensitivity).

By combining volume clusters with volatility filters, the VolClusterBreakout strategy aims to capture high-probability breakout opportunities while minimizing false signals.
