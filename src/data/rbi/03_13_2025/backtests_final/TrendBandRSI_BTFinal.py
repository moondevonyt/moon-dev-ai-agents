To address the issues in the backtesting code, here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Avoid Using Deprecated Imports:**
   - `pandas_ta` has deprecated some functions (e.g., `ewma`, `rsi`). Instead, use the indicators directly from `talib`.

2. **Correct RSI Calculation:**
   - Use the standard deviation correctly to create Bollinger Bands around the RSI instead of adding it.

3. **Handle Data Indexing Properly:**
   - Ensure that all required data points exist before accessing them to prevent KeyErrors or unexpected behavior.

4. **Prevent Division by Zero or Negative Values:**
   - Add checks for valid price differences when calculating position sizes.

5. **Correct Typo in Stats Attribute:**
   - The stats object should reference `stats.strategy` if using the newer structure.

6. **Import Statements:**
   - Ensure that all necessary libraries are imported correctly and consistently throughout the code.

By implementing these fixes, the backtesting strategy should function as intended without errors related to deprecated functions or incorrect calculations.
