To address the potential issues with your trading strategy's position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms, here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Review Position Sizing Calculation**
   - **Current Method**: The position size is calculated using `int(round(risk_amount / risk_per_share))`. This might not account for all contributing factors (e.g., RSI, HV, AV) correctly.
   - **Suggested Change**: Ensure each factor contributes to the overall risk. Consider a formula that weights each condition appropriately or use a consistent volatility measure.

### 2. **Consistency in Volatility Measures**
   - **Current Practice**: Both historical and absolute volatilities are used (HV and AV).
   - **Suggested Adjustment**: Decide on a single volatility measure to avoid double-counting risk. Use HV, AV, or another method consistently.

### 3. **Risk Per Share Calculation**
   - **Current Issue**: Risk per share is calculated once but might not reflect all trading conditions.
   - **Solution**: Re-evaluate the formula to include all contributing factors (e.g., RSI thresholds and multiple volatility metrics) to get an accurate risk assessment.

### 4. **Printing Precision**
   - **Suggested Change**: While minimal, reduce decimal places in output for clarity but ensure calculations use precise values.

### 5. **Stop Loss Mechanism**
   - **Current Practice**: Using absolute stops might not adapt well to market volatility.
   - **Adjustment**: Consider implementing relative or trailing stop losses alongside absolute stops for better risk management.

### 6. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Importance**: Conduct thorough testing (e.g., walk-forward analysis) to validate the adjusted position sizing and stop-loss strategies across various market conditions.

By addressing these points, you can refine your strategy to ensure more accurate position sizing and effective risk management, enhancing its overall performance and reliability.
