STRATEGY_NAME: FractalStochastic

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalStochastic strategy is a trend-following approach that combines fractal channel analysis with stochastic oscillator signals to identify high-probability trade setups. This strategy is designed to capture trends while filtering out false signals using the stochastic oscillator's overbought/oversold conditions.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fractal Channels**: 
   - Fractal channels are used to identify the overall trend direction and potential breakout levels.
   - Upper and lower fractal levels act as dynamic support and resistance zones.
   - A breakout above the upper fractal channel confirms an uptrend, while a breakout below the lower fractal channel confirms a downtrend.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator**:
   - The stochastic oscillator (14,3,3) is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
   - Overbought conditions (above 80) suggest potential pullbacks in an uptrend.
   - Oversold conditions (below 20) suggest potential reversals in a downtrend.
   - The stochastic crossover (e.g., %K crossing above %D) is used to confirm momentum shifts.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Price breaks above the upper fractal channel, confirming an uptrend.
   - Stochastic oscillator is below 20 (oversold) and begins to rise, indicating momentum is shifting upward.
   - Enter a long position when the stochastic %K crosses above %D.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Price breaks below the lower fractal channel, confirming a downtrend.
   - Stochastic oscillator is above 80 (overbought) and begins to decline, indicating momentum is shifting downward.
   - Enter a short position when the stochastic %K crosses below %D.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use the opposite fractal channel as a take-profit target. For example, in a long trade, exit when price reaches the lower fractal channel.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on recent fractal levels.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss just below the most recent fractal low for long trades or above the most recent fractal high for short trades.
   - Adjust the stop loss as new fractal levels form to lock in profits.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Calculate position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss levels.

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Avoid trading during low volatility periods when fractal channels are too narrow.
   - Wait for stochastic confirmation to reduce false breakouts.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fractal Channels**:
   - Use a fractal indicator to plot upper and lower fractal levels dynamically.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)**:
   - Set to standard settings (14-period %K, 3-period %D, 3-period smoothing).

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise and improve signal accuracy.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or news events to avoid trading against major market-moving events.

By combining fractal channel breakouts with stochastic oscillator confirmation, the FractalStochastic strategy provides a robust framework for identifying and trading trends with controlled risk.
