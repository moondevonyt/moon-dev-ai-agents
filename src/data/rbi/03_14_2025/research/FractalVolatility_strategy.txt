STRATEGY_NAME: FractalVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalVolatility strategy combines fractal analysis with Bollinger Bands and ATR-based volatility measurements to identify high-probability trading opportunities. The strategy focuses on divergence patterns between price action and fractal indicators, while using Bollinger Bands as a confirmation tool. Exits are determined by ATR multiples during periods of increased volatility, ensuring risk is managed effectively.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fractal Indicator**: Identifies potential reversal points in price action.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to confirm the strength of the divergence and identify overbought/oversold conditions.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**: Measures volatility to determine exit points and position sizing.
4. **Price Action Alignment**: Ensures trades are taken in the direction of the prevailing trend.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Divergence Identification**:
   - Look for bullish divergence when price makes a lower low, but the fractal indicator makes a higher low.
   - Look for bearish divergence when price makes a higher high, but the fractal indicator makes a lower high.
2. **Bollinger Bands Confirmation**:
   - For bullish divergence, ensure price is near the lower Bollinger Band.
   - For bearish divergence, ensure price is near the upper Bollinger Band.
3. **Price Action Alignment**:
   - Enter a long trade if the divergence is bullish and price breaks above a recent swing high.
   - Enter a short trade if the divergence is bearish and price breaks below a recent swing low.

### Exit Rules:
1. **ATR-Based Exits**:
   - Calculate the ATR value over a 14-period lookback.
   - Set the initial stop-loss at 1.5x ATR from the entry price.
   - For take-profit, use 2x ATR from the entry price.
2. **Volatility Adjustment**:
   - If volatility increases (ATR rises by more than 20% during the trade), tighten the stop-loss to 1x ATR.
   - If volatility decreases (ATR drops by more than 20% during the trade), consider exiting early to lock in profits.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading account on any single trade.
   - Use ATR to adjust position size based on current volatility.
2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - Always use the ATR-based stop-loss to limit downside risk.
3. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only take trades when the divergence is clear and confirmed by Bollinger Bands.
   - Avoid trading during low-volume periods or when ATR is below its 20-period average.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fractal Indicator**: To identify potential reversals and divergence patterns.
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)**: To confirm overbought/oversold conditions and divergence strength.
3. **ATR (14)**: To measure volatility and determine stop-loss/take-profit levels.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise and false signals.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or news events to avoid trading during high-impact news releases.
- Regularly backtest and optimize the ATR multiples and Bollinger Band settings to suit the specific asset being traded.

By following the FractalVolatility strategy, traders can capitalize on divergence patterns while effectively managing risk through volatility-based exits.
