STRATEGY_NAME: GoldenVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The GoldenVolatility strategy combines the Stochastic Oscillator (SO), Bollinger Bands, and a Golden Ratio filter to identify high-probability entry and exit points during overbought/oversold conditions. It also incorporates dynamic position sizing based on volatility spikes to optimize risk management.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (SO):**
   - Used to identify overbought (above 80) and oversold (below 20) conditions.
   - Look for crossovers of the %K and %D lines to confirm momentum shifts.

2. **Bollinger Bands:**
   - Used to measure volatility and identify potential breakout or reversal points.
   - The middle band (20-period SMA) acts as a baseline, while the upper and lower bands indicate volatility extremes.

3. **Golden Ratio Filter:**
   - Applies a Fibonacci-based filter (e.g., 0.618 or 1.618) to refine entry/exit signals.
   - Ensures trades align with key price levels derived from the Golden Ratio.

4. **Volatility-Based Position Sizing:**
   - Adjusts position size based on the width of Bollinger Bands (volatility spikes).
   - Larger positions during low volatility and smaller positions during high volatility.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry:**
   - Stochastic Oscillator is in oversold territory (below 20).
   - %K line crosses above the %D line, indicating bullish momentum.
   - Price is near the lower Bollinger Band or a Golden Ratio support level.
   - Confirm with a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., hammer, engulfing).

2. **Short Entry:**
   - Stochastic Oscillator is in overbought territory (above 80).
   - %K line crosses below the %D line, indicating bearish momentum.
   - Price is near the upper Bollinger Band or a Golden Ratio resistance level.
   - Confirm with a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., shooting star, engulfing).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit:**
   - Close the trade when the Stochastic Oscillator reaches the opposite extreme (overbought for long trades, oversold for short trades).
   - Alternatively, use the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) as a trailing stop.

2. **Stop Loss:**
   - Place the stop loss just below the nearest Golden Ratio support level for long trades.
   - Place the stop loss just above the nearest Golden Ratio resistance level for short trades.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:**
   - Calculate position size based on the width of Bollinger Bands.
   - Use the formula: Position Size = (Account Risk % * Account Balance) / (Stop Loss Distance * Volatility Multiplier).
   - Volatility Multiplier adjusts based on Bollinger Band width (e.g., wider bands = smaller position).

2. **Risk Per Trade:**
   - Limit risk to 1-2% of the account balance per trade.

3. **Volatility Filter:**
   - Avoid trading during extreme volatility spikes (e.g., Bollinger Bands expanding rapidly).

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3):**
   - Default settings for identifying overbought/oversold conditions.

2. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2):**
   - 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations for volatility measurement.

3. **Golden Ratio Levels:**
   - Use Fibonacci retracement tool to plot key levels (e.g., 0.618, 1.618).

4. **Candlestick Patterns:**
   - Monitor for confirmation patterns (e.g., hammer, engulfing, shooting star).

### Summary:
The GoldenVolatility strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines momentum, volatility, and Fibonacci-based price levels to identify high-probability trades. By dynamically adjusting position sizing based on volatility, it ensures optimal risk management while capitalizing on overbought/oversold conditions. This strategy is ideal for traders who prefer a systematic, rules-based approach with a focus on precision and risk control.
