STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergenceVolatility strategy combines RSI, MACD histogram divergence, and ATR-based volatility thresholds to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in trending markets. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Components:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** - Used to identify overbought conditions (typically above 70).
2. **MACD Histogram Divergence** - Detects bearish divergence when price makes higher highs while MACD histogram makes lower highs.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)** - Measures market volatility to determine exit points when price movement exceeds predefined levels.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition 1**: RSI must be above 70, indicating an overbought market condition.
2. **Condition 2**: MACD histogram must show bearish divergence (price makes higher highs while MACD histogram makes lower highs).
3. **Entry Signal**: Enter a short position when both conditions are met simultaneously.

---

### Exit Rules:
1. **Volatility-Based Exit**: Use ATR to determine exit points. If the price moves against the position by a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1.5x or 2x ATR), exit the trade.
2. **Profit Target**: Optionally, set a profit target based on a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
3. **Time-Based Exit**: If the trade does not reach the profit target or stop-loss within a predefined time frame (e.g., 5-10 candles), exit the position.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account balance).
2. **Stop-Loss**: Place a stop-loss at a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1x ATR) below the entry price for short positions.
3. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during periods of extremely high volatility (e.g., when ATR is above a certain threshold).

---

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (14-period default)** - To identify overbought conditions.
2. **MACD (12, 26, 9 default)** - To detect histogram divergence.
3. **ATR (14-period default)** - To measure volatility and set exit levels.

---

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear momentum shifts.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to ensure robustness.
- Adjust ATR multiples and RSI thresholds based on the asset's volatility and historical performance.

By combining divergence signals with volatility-based exits, DivergenceVolatility aims to capture reversals while managing risk effectively.
