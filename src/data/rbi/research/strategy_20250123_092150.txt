**Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting**  

---

### **1. Key Strategy Components**  
- **Strategy Type**: Technical breakout swing trading (long-only).  
- **Instruments**: Large-cap stocks (>$1B market cap) trading **above 200 SMA** (daily chart).  
- **Core Concepts**:  
  - Trade breakouts from multi-test resistance levels.  
  - Use **8 EMA** as a dynamic support/trailing stop.  
  - Confirm momentum with volume spikes.  
  - Prioritize stocks in consolidation phases before breakout.

### **2. Entry Rules**  
**Trigger Conditions**:  
1. **Resistance Breakout**: Price closes **above a resistance level** tested ≥2 times on the daily chart.  
2. **EMA Alignment**: Stock must be trending above **8 EMA** and **200 SMA**.  
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Breakout candle must have **≥150% of 30-day average volume**.  

**Entry Execution**:  
- Enter on the **next daily open** after the breakout confirmation.  
- **Ideal Entry**: Pullback to **8 EMA** after initial breakout (prioritize entries near 8 EMA).

### **3. Exit Rules**  
**Profit-Taking**:  
- **Sell 25%** of position at **1:1 risk-reward ratio** (e.g., if risk is $1, take profit at $1 gain).  
- **Sell another 25%** when price deviates **>5% from 8 EMA**.  
- **Trailing Stop**: Remaining 50% held until price closes **below 8 EMA** on the daily chart.  

**Stop-Loss**:  
- Initial stop: **Daily close below 8 EMA**.  
- After partial exits, move stop to **breakeven** on remaining position.

### **4. Risk Management**  
- **Position Size**: Risk **≤2% of account per trade**.  
  - Calculate position size: `(Account Risk) / (Entry Price – Stop Price)`.  
- **Maximum Holdings**: 5 open positions to avoid overconcentration.  
- **Avoid**: Stocks below 200 SMA or with <500k daily volume.  

---

### **5. Required Indicators**  
1. **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**:  
   - Used for momentum confirmation and trailing stop.  
2. **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**:  
   - Filters for long-term bullish bias (only trade above 200 SMA).  
3. **Volume**:  
   - Confirm breakout validity (spike ≥150% of average volume).  

---

### **6. Backtesting Parameters**  
- **Timeframe**: Daily charts (use 15m/1H for entry refinement).  
- **Data Requirements**: Historical daily OHLCV + 8 EMA/200 SMA values.  
- **Metrics to Track**:  
  - Win rate, risk-reward ratio, max drawdown.  
  - Performance in varying market conditions (bullish/consolidation).  

--- 

**Notes**:  
- Prioritize stocks with a history of respecting 8 EMA as support.  
- Exclude earnings periods and major news events to avoid false breakouts.  
- Validate strategy against 2020–2023 market data (includes bull/bear cycles).
