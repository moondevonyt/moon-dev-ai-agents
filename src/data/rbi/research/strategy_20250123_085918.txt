### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Igniting Bars**: Focus on bars that "ignite" or initiate a strong move, typically characterized by clearing out congestion or originating near key moving averages (20 EMA, 200 EMA).
2. **Elephant Bars**: Look for large, powerful bars (Elephant Bars) that originate near the 20 EMA or 200 EMA and clear out significant price congestion to the left.
3. **Trend Maturity**: Identify mature trends with multiple legs, as these are less likely to continue strongly and may signal exhaustion.
4. **Clearing Events**: Bars that wipe out congestion areas before them (clearing events) have a high probability of follow-through (80-90%).
5. **Exhaustion vs. Continuation**: Determine if a bar is likely to continue the trend (igniting continuation) or signal exhaustion (originating far from the 20 EMA).

#### Entry Rules:
1. **Buy Entry**:
   - Look for a bullish Elephant Bar that originates near the 20 EMA or 200 EMA.
   - The bar must clear out congestion to the left, indicating a strong move.
   - Enter on the close of the bar or the next candle after confirmation.

2. **Sell Entry**:
   - Look for a bearish Elephant Bar that originates near the 20 EMA or 200 EMA.
   - The bar must clear out congestion to the left, indicating a strong move.
   - Enter on the close of the bar or the next candle after confirmation.

#### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use the concept of follow-through: If the bar has a clearing event, expect an 80-90% probability of continuation.
   - Set profit targets based on the size of the Elephant Bar or key support/resistance levels.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stops below the low of the Elephant Bar for long positions or above the high for short positions.
   - Adjust stops based on the distance from the 20 EMA or 200 EMA to account for volatility.

#### Risk Management:
1. **Maximum Loss per Trade**: Define a maximum loss per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account equity) and ensure stops are placed accordingly.
2. **Position Sizing**: Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop loss to maintain consistent risk per trade.
3. **Avoid Overleveraging**: Do not overleverage, especially in mature trends where follow-through may be limited.

#### Required Indicators:
1. **20 EMA**: Use the 20-period Exponential Moving Average to identify origination points for Elephant Bars.
2. **200 EMA**: Use the 200-period Exponential Moving Average to confirm long-term trend alignment.
3. **Price Action**: Focus on price action and congestion areas to identify clearing events and follow-through potential.

#### Additional Notes:
- **Practice and Data Collection**: Create folders for "Igniting" and "Exhaustion" examples to study and internalize the patterns.
- **Trend Maturity Awareness**: Avoid entering trades in highly mature trends, as follow-through is less likely.
- **No 100% Guarantees**: Always use stops and risk management, as no strategy is 100% accurate.
