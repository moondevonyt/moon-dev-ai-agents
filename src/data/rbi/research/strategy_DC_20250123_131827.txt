### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Intraday (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Market**: Suitable for liquid markets with consistent volume (e.g., stocks, futures, or forex).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price interaction with VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Entry**:
     - Buy when the price crosses **below** the VWAP and then **reverts back above** it.
     - Sell when the price crosses **above** the VWAP and then **reverts back below** it.
   - **Trend-Following Entry**:
     - Buy when the price is **above** the VWAP and continues to move upward.
     - Sell when the price is **below** the VWAP and continues to move downward.
   - **Confirmation**: Use a 1-2 candle close above/below VWAP to confirm the signal.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a fixed percentage or points-based target (e.g., 0.5% or 10 pips).
     - Alternatively, exit when the price crosses back to the opposite side of the VWAP.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place a stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or points-based stop loss (e.g., 0.25% or 5 pips).
   - **Time-Based Exit**: Exit the trade at the end of the trading session if not stopped out or taken profit.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the account balance per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio.
   - **Max Daily Loss**: Stop trading for the day if the account reaches a 3-5% drawdown.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume-Weighted Average Price (standard indicator available on most trading platforms).
   - **Optional Confirmation Indicators**:
     - Moving Average (e.g., 9-period EMA) to confirm trend direction.
     - Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
     - Volume Profile to confirm high-volume areas near VWAP.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Time Period**: Test over at least 3-6 months of intraday data.
   - **Market Conditions**: Include both trending and ranging markets.
   - **Slippage and Commissions**: Account for realistic trading costs.
   - **Optimization**: Test different timeframes, stop loss levels, and take profit targets to find optimal settings.

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - Avoid trading during low-volume periods (e.g., lunch hours or market open/close).
   - Combine VWAP with price action (e.g., support/resistance levels) for higher accuracy.
   - Monitor volume spikes for confirmation of breakout or reversal signals.
