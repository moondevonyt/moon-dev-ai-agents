### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Use intraday data (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Market**: Suitable for liquid markets with consistent volume (e.g., stocks, futures, or forex).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price interaction with VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Bullish Entry**:
     - Price crosses above VWAP.
     - Volume should be above average (confirming strength).
     - Optional: Add a confirmation filter (e.g., RSI > 50 or MACD crossover).
   - **Bearish Entry**:
     - Price crosses below VWAP.
     - Volume should be above average (confirming weakness).
     - Optional: Add a confirmation filter (e.g., RSI < 50 or MACD crossover).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Fixed percentage or points above/below the entry price.
     - Alternatively, exit when price reverts to VWAP.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Fixed percentage or points below/above the entry price.
     - Alternatively, exit if price moves beyond a predefined distance from VWAP (e.g., 1.5x ATR).

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of the account per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set stop loss based on volatility (e.g., 1x ATR or a fixed percentage).
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Optional: Use a trailing stop to lock in profits as price moves in your favor.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price.
   - **Volume**: To confirm strength/weakness at entry points.
   - **Optional Indicators**:
     - RSI (Relative Strength Index) for overbought/oversold confirmation.
     - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) for trend confirmation.
     - ATR (Average True Range) for setting stop loss levels.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Backtesting Parameters**:
     - Test over multiple timeframes (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute).
     - Test across different market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile).
   - **Optimization**:
     - Adjust stop loss and take profit levels based on historical performance.
     - Test different confirmation filters (e.g., RSI thresholds, MACD settings).

This strategy is designed for intraday trading and relies heavily on price interaction with VWAP. Adjust parameters based on the specific market and asset being traded.
