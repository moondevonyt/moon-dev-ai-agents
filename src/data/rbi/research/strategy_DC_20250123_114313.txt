### Capitulation Volume Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
- **Objective**: Identify potential market reversals or trend continuations based on extreme volume spikes (capitulation volume).
- **Market Condition**: Works best in trending or volatile markets.
- **Timeframe**: Suitable for intraday, daily, or higher timeframes.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
- **Capitulation Volume Signal**:
  - Look for a significant spike in volume that is at least **2x the average volume** of the last 20 candles.
  - The price should close near the **low** of the candle for a **bearish capitulation** or near the **high** for a **bullish capitulation**.
- **Confirmation**:
  - For a **bullish reversal**: Wait for the next candle to close **above the high** of the capitulation candle.
  - For a **bearish reversal**: Wait for the next candle to close **below the low** of the capitulation candle.
- **Trend Filter** (Optional):
  - Use a **200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)** to confirm the trend direction.
    - For a **bullish setup**, ensure the price is above the 200 SMA.
    - For a **bearish setup**, ensure the price is below the 200 SMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
- **Take Profit**:
  - Set a take profit level at **1.5x the average true range (ATR)** of the last 14 candles from the entry point.
- **Stop Loss**:
  - Place a stop loss at the **low** of the capitulation candle for a **bullish trade** or the **high** of the capitulation candle for a **bearish trade**.
- **Trailing Stop** (Optional):
  - Use a trailing stop of **0.5x ATR** to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
- **Position Sizing**:
  - Risk no more than **1-2% of your trading capital** per trade.
  - Calculate position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
  - Aim for a minimum **1:1.5 risk-reward ratio**.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
- **Volume Indicator**:
  - Use standard volume to identify the capitulation spike.
- **Average True Range (ATR)**:
  - Set to 14 periods for measuring volatility and setting take profit/stop loss levels.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
  - Use a 200-period SMA as a trend filter (optional).

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
- **Data Requirements**:
  - Historical price data with volume.
- **Timeframe**:
  - Test on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to assess strategy robustness.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track win rate, average profit/loss per trade, maximum drawdown, and risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio).

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
- **Market Context**:
  - Avoid using the strategy during low-volume or sideways market conditions.
- **Confirmation**:
  - Consider adding additional confirmation signals (e.g., RSI divergence, candlestick patterns) to reduce false signals.
