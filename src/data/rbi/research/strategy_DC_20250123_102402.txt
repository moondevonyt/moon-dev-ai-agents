### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Market Structure Identification**: Identify external swing points (highs and lows) to determine the directional bias (bullish or bearish).
   - **Premium and Discount Zones**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels to identify premium (above 50%) and discount (below 50%) zones within the price leg.
   - **Confluence Areas**: Combine market structure with order blocks or fair value gaps (FVGs) to pinpoint high-probability entry zones.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for directional bias and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entry triggers.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Step 1: Identify Market Structure**
     - Mark external swing highs and lows.
     - Confirm bullish structure: higher highs and higher lows.
     - Confirm bearish structure: lower highs and lower lows.
   - **Step 2: Define Premium and Discount**
     - Draw Fibonacci retracement from the swing low to the swing high.
     - Discount zone: Below 50% retracement (ideal for buying in bullish trends).
     - Premium zone: Above 50% retracement (ideal for selling in bearish trends).
   - **Step 3: Locate Confluence Areas**
     - Look for order blocks or FVGs within the discount zone for bullish trades or premium zone for bearish trades.
     - Order Block: A 3-candle formation with aggressive momentum (e.g., bearish candle followed by two bullish candles).
     - Fair Value Gap (FVG): A gap between the wicks of three candles, indicating strong buying or selling pressure.
   - **Step 4: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**
     - On the higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute), wait for price to pull back into the discount or premium zone.
     - Switch to the lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) and wait for a structural shift (e.g., bullish reversal in a discount zone for a long trade).
     - Enter the trade when the lower timeframe confirms the reversal.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Target the next external swing high (for bullish trades) or swing low (for bearish trades).
     - Use a 1:5 or 1:7 risk-to-reward ratio.
     - Close 50% of the position at 5x risk reward and let the remaining position run to the full target.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place the stop loss below the swing low (for bullish trades) or above the swing high (for bearish trades).
     - Alternatively, place the stop loss below the order block or FVG for tighter risk management.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of the account per trade.
   - **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum of 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio.
   - **Stop Loss Placement**:
     - Use the swing low (for bullish trades) or swing high (for bearish trades) as the stop loss level.
     - Alternatively, use the bottom of the order block or FVG for tighter stops.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
     - Used to identify premium and discount zones.
   - **Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps**:
     - Manually identify these areas on the chart.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**:
     - Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for structure and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for entries.

### Step-by-Step Trade Execution Example (Bullish Trade)
1. **Identify Market Structure**:
   - Mark the swing low and swing high on the 15-minute chart.
   - Confirm a bullish structure (higher highs and higher lows).
2. **Draw Fibonacci Retracement**:
   - Draw from the swing low to the swing high.
   - Identify the discount zone (below 50%).
3. **Locate Confluence Area**:
   - Find an order block or FVG within the discount zone.
4. **Switch to Lower Timeframe**:
   - On the 1-minute chart, wait for a bullish reversal (e.g., higher low and higher high).
5. **Enter the Trade**:
   - Place a buy order at the confluence area (e.g., order block or FVG).
   - Set the stop loss below the swing low or confluence area.
6. **Set Take Profit**:
   - Target the next external swing high.
   - Close 50% of the position at 5x risk reward and let the rest run to the full target.

### Step-by-Step Trade Execution Example (Bearish Trade)
1. **Identify Market Structure**:
   - Mark the swing high and swing low on the 15-minute chart.
   - Confirm a bearish structure (lower highs and lower lows).

   - Draw from the swing high to the swing low.
   - Identify the premium zone (above 50%).
3. **Locate Confluence Area**:
   - Find an order block or FVG within the premium zone.

   - On the 1-minute chart, wait for a bearish reversal (e.g., lower high and lower low).
5. **Enter the Trade**:
   - Place a sell order at the confluence area (e.g., order block or FVG).
   - Set the stop loss above the swing high or confluence area.

### Notes for Backtesting
- Ensure all trades are taken only when confluence areas align with market structure and premium/discount zones.
- Use historical data to validate the accuracy of order blocks and FVGs.
- Track win rate, risk-to-reward ratio, and overall profitability over a large sample size of trades.
