### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for broader context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Used to determine the long-term trend. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm breakouts and breakdowns.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: A stock breaks through a key resistance level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Breakdown**: A stock breaks below a key support level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Consolidation**: A stock trades within a tight range before a potential breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with volume > 500k and positive price movement (>3%) during midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
     - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA and trending along the 8 EMA.
   - **Entry Criteria**:
     - Look for a breakout above a key resistance level that has been tested at least 2-3 times.
     - Enter the trade as close to the 8 EMA as possible, ideally during a pullback to the 8 EMA after the breakout.
     - Avoid entering if the stock is too far extended from the 8 EMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 25% at a time) as the stock moves higher, especially when it pulls away from the 8 EMA.
     - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA, selling more as the stock continues to trend.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place the stop loss below the 8 EMA. If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the trade.
     - Once partial profits are taken, move the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Always use a stop loss below the 8 EMA to limit potential losses.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Avoid over-concentration in a single stock or sector. Spread risk across multiple trades.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **8 EMA**: Momentum indicator for trend direction.
   - **200 SMA**: Long-term trend filter.
   - **Volume**: Confirmation of breakout/breakdown strength.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Time Frame**: Daily charts.
   - **Data Range**: At least 1-2 years of historical data to capture multiple breakout/breakdown scenarios.
   - **Metrics to Track**:
     - Win rate (percentage of winning trades).
     - Average profit per trade.
     - Average loss per trade.
     - Risk-reward ratio.
     - Maximum drawdown.
   - **Scenarios to Test**:
     - Breakouts above resistance with volume confirmation.
     - Breakdowns below support with volume confirmation.
     - Consolidation patterns leading to breakouts or breakdowns.
   - **Optimization**:
     - Test different EMA periods (e.g., 8 EMA vs. 10 EMA) to see which performs best.
     - Experiment with different stop-loss levels (e.g., below 8 EMA vs. below recent swing low).
     - Adjust position sizing rules to optimize risk-reward.

#### 7. **Execution**
   - **Broker**: Use a broker that supports bracket orders and OCO (One Cancels the Other) orders for easy entry and exit management.
   - **Charting Platform**: Use TradingView or a similar platform for chart analysis and pattern recognition.

#### 8. **Additional Notes**
   - **Patience**: Swing trading requires patience. Wait for the right setups and avoid overtrading.
   - **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-probability setups rather than taking every potential trade.
   - **Review**: Regularly review your trades to identify patterns of success and areas for improvement.
