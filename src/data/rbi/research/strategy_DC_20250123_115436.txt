### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Intraday (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Market**: Suitable for liquid assets with consistent volume (e.g., stocks, futures, or major forex pairs).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price interaction with VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Entry**:
     1. Wait for the price to deviate significantly from the VWAP (e.g., >1.5% above or below).
     2. Enter a **short position** if the price is significantly above VWAP and shows signs of reversal (e.g., bearish candlestick patterns or RSI overbought).
     3. Enter a **long position** if the price is significantly below VWAP and shows signs of reversal (e.g., bullish candlestick patterns or RSI oversold).
   - **Trend-Following Entry**:
     1. Enter a **long position** if the price crosses above VWAP with increasing volume and momentum (e.g., MACD crossover or RSI > 50).
     2. Enter a **short position** if the price crosses below VWAP with increasing volume and momentum (e.g., MACD crossover or RSI < 50).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Exit**:
     1. Close the position when the price returns to the VWAP or reaches a predefined profit target (e.g., 1% from entry).
     2. Use a trailing stop-loss to lock in profits if the price moves favorably.
   - **Trend-Following Exit**:
     1. Close the position when the price crosses back below VWAP (for long positions) or above VWAP (for short positions).
     2. Use a trailing stop-loss to protect gains if the trend continues.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the account per trade.
   - **Stop-Loss**:
     - For mean-reversion trades, place a stop-loss at a fixed percentage (e.g., 0.5-1%) beyond the entry point.
     - For trend-following trades, use a trailing stop-loss based on ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR).
   - **Profit Target**: Set a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 (e.g., 1% risk for 2% reward).
   - **Time-Based Exit**: Exit all positions before the market closes to avoid overnight risk.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Primary indicator for identifying the average price weighted by volume.
   - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Optional for confirming overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Optional for confirming momentum.
   - **ATR (Average True Range)**: Optional for setting dynamic stop-loss levels.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Time Period**: Test over at least 6 months of intraday data.
   - **Asset Selection**: Use assets with high liquidity and consistent volume.
   - **Slippage and Fees**: Account for transaction costs and slippage in the backtest.
   - **Optimization**: Test different VWAP deviation thresholds (e.g., 1%, 1.5%, 2%) and profit targets to find optimal settings.

This strategy can be backtested using historical intraday data to evaluate its performance under different market conditions. Adjust parameters as needed based on the asset and timeframe.
