### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Enhance momentum trading using deep learning to predict stock returns.
   - **Data Source**: US stock data from CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices).
   - **Stock Selection**: 
     - Include ordinary shares traded on NYSE, AMEX, or Nasdaq.
     - Exclude stocks with monthly closing prices below $5 at portfolio formation.
   - **Training Period**: January 1965 to December 1989.
   - **Test Period**: January 1990 to December 2009.
   - **Input Features**:
     - 12 monthly returns (months t-2 to t-13).
     - 20 daily returns (approximately month t).
     - January indicator variable (1 if holding period is January, else 0).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Compute cumulative returns for monthly and daily returns.
     - Normalize cumulative returns using z-scores relative to the cross-section of all stocks for each month/day.
     - Label stocks with returns below the median as class 1 (losers) and above the median as class 2 (winners).

#### 2. **Entry/Exit Rules**
   - **Model Prediction**:
     - Use a deep learning model (stacked autoencoder with RBMs and FFNN classifier) to predict class probabilities (class 1 or class 2) for each stock.
     - Rank stocks each month by their predicted class 2 probability (probability of being a winner).
   - **Portfolio Formation**:
     - **Long Position**: Buy stocks in the top decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
     - **Short Position**: Sell stocks in the bottom decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
   - **Holding Period**: Hold positions for one month.
   - **Rebalancing**: Close positions at the end of the month and form new long/short portfolios based on updated predictions.

#### 3. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Equal-weighted positions in the top and bottom deciles.
   - **Stop-Loss**: Not explicitly mentioned in the strategy, but consider implementing a stop-loss mechanism to limit losses.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio by including multiple stocks in the long and short positions.
   - **Transaction Costs**: Account for trading costs, slippage, and market impact when calculating returns.

#### 4. **Required Indicators**
   - **Input Features**:
     - 12 monthly cumulative returns (normalized z-scores).
     - 20 daily cumulative returns (normalized z-scores).
     - January indicator variable.
   - **Model Output**:
     - Predicted class 2 probability for each stock.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Monthly returns for long and short portfolios.
     - Annualized returns.
     - T-statistics for strategy performance.

#### 5. **Backtesting Procedure**
   - **Data Preparation**:
     - Load historical stock price data for the specified period.
     - Preprocess data to compute cumulative returns and normalize using z-scores.
     - Label stocks based on median returns for the next month.
   - **Model Training**:
     - Train the deep learning model (stacked autoencoder with RBMs and FFNN classifier) on the training set (1965-1989).
     - Use hold-out cross-validation to determine the optimal network architecture.
   - **Model Testing**:
     - Apply the trained model to the test set (1990-2009) to predict class probabilities.
     - Form long and short portfolios based on predicted probabilities.
     - Calculate monthly returns for the strategy.
   - **Performance Evaluation**:
     - Compare the enhanced momentum strategy with the basic momentum strategy (based on past 12-month returns).
     - Calculate annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, and other relevant performance metrics.
     - Analyze the source of returns by examining past 12-month and 20-day returns for the long and short portfolios.

#### 6. **Implementation Notes**
   - **Computational Resources**: Ensure sufficient computational resources for training the deep learning model, especially if using GPUs.
   - **Model Updates**: Consider updating the model weights periodically to adapt to changing market conditions.
   - **Parallelization**: Explore parallel implementation of the learning algorithm to reduce training time.

This strategy leverages deep learning to enhance traditional momentum trading, focusing on extracting predictive features from historical price data without extensive manual feature engineering.
