### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### **1. Key Strategy Components**
- **Objective**: Capture multi-day to multi-week price movements using technical analysis.
- **Focus**: Large-cap stocks with strong momentum and clear chart patterns.
- **Core Indicators**:
  - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Momentum indicator for trend direction.
  - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Long-term trend filter (only trade stocks above 200 SMA).
  - **Volume**: Confirms breakout strength and momentum.
- **Chart Patterns**:
  - **Breakout**: Stock breaks above a key resistance level.
  - **Breakdown**: Stock breaks below a key support level.
  - **Consolidation**: Stock trades in a tight range before a breakout or breakdown.

#### **2. Entry Rules**
1. **Stock Selection**:
   - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (>$1 billion market cap) with:
     - Price > $1 per share.
     - Volume > 500k by midday (11:00 AM - 12:00 PM Eastern Time).
     - Positive price movement (>3% intraday).
   - Ensure the stock is above the **200 SMA** (long-term bullish trend).

2. **Chart Analysis**:
   - Look for stocks trending along or reclaiming the **8 EMA** (momentum indicator).
   - Identify key **resistance levels** (for breakouts) or **support levels** (for breakdowns).
   - Confirm **consolidation patterns** (tight trading ranges) before a breakout.

3. **Entry Trigger**:
   - Enter the trade when the stock **breaks above resistance** (for long positions) or **breaks below support** (for short positions).
   - Ideal entry is as close to the **8 EMA** as possible (pullback to the EMA is preferred).

#### **3. Exit Rules**
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Sell in **partial sizes** (e.g., 25% at first breakout, 25% at next resistance, and trail the remaining 50% along the 8 EMA).
   - Exit fully if the stock shows signs of **losing momentum** (e.g., breaks below the 8 EMA or fails to hold key levels).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss **below the 8 EMA** for long positions or **above the 8 EMA** for short positions.
   - If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the trade immediately.

#### **4. Risk Management**
- **Position Sizing**:
  - Risk no more than **1-2% of your account** per trade.
  - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
  - Aim for a minimum **1:2 risk-reward ratio** (e.g., risk $1 to make $2).
- **Trailing Stops**:
  - Use the **8 EMA** as a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

#### **5. Required Indicators**
1. **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**:
   - Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
   - Acts as a dynamic support/resistance level.
2. **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**:
   - Filters out weak stocks (only trade stocks above the 200 SMA).
   - Confirms long-term bullish trends.
3. **Volume**:
   - Confirms breakout strength (look for above-average volume on breakouts).
   - Helps identify momentum shifts.

#### **6. Backtesting Setup**
1. **Timeframe**:
   - Use **daily charts** for swing trading analysis.
   - Optionally, use **weekly charts** for longer-term trends.
2. **Data Requirements**:
   - Historical price data for large-cap stocks.
   - Volume data for confirmation of breakouts.
3. **Backtesting Parameters**:
   - Test the strategy on stocks that meet the criteria (above 200 SMA, trending along 8 EMA, and breaking key resistance/support levels).
   - Evaluate performance based on:
     - Win rate (percentage of profitable trades).
     - Average risk-reward ratio.
     - Drawdown and overall account growth.
