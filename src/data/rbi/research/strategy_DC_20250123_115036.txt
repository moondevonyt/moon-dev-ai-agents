### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Enhance momentum trading strategies using deep learning (stacked autoencoders with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) to predict stock returns.
   - **Input Data**: 
     - **Monthly Returns**: 12 months of historical monthly returns (from month t-13 to t-2).
     - **Daily Returns**: 20 days of historical daily returns (approximately corresponding to month t).
     - **January Indicator**: Binary variable indicating if the holding period (month t+1) falls in January.
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Compute cumulative returns for both monthly and daily returns.
     - Normalize cumulative returns using z-scores relative to the cross-section of all stocks for each month/day.
     - Label stocks as class 1 (below median return) or class 2 (above median return) based on returns in month t+1.
   - **Model Architecture**:
     - Stacked autoencoder with RBMs: 33 input features → 40 hidden units → 4 bottleneck units → 50 hidden units → 2 output classes.
     - Feedforward neural network (FFNN) classifier for final prediction.

#### 2. **Entry/Exit Rules**
   - **Portfolio Formation**:
     - Rank stocks each month based on the predicted probability of being in class 2 (high return).
     - **Long Position**: Buy stocks in the top decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
     - **Short Position**: Sell stocks in the bottom decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
   - **Holding Period**:
     - Hold positions for one month (month t+1).
     - Close positions at the end of the holding period and rebalance the portfolio.
   - **Rebalancing**:
     - Repeat the ranking and portfolio formation process monthly.

#### 3. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Equal weighting for all stocks in the long and short portfolios.
   - **Stop-Loss**:
     - No explicit stop-loss rule; positions are held for the full month regardless of intra-month performance.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Portfolio includes a diversified set of stocks across deciles to mitigate individual stock risk.
   - **Exclusion Criteria**:
     - Exclude stocks with monthly closing prices below $5 to reduce noise and extreme returns.

#### 4. **Required Indicators**
   - **Input Features**:
     - 12 months of historical monthly returns (t-13 to t-2).
     - 20 days of historical daily returns (approximately month t).
     - January indicator (binary variable).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Cumulative returns for monthly and daily data.
     - Z-score normalization of cumulative returns.
   - **Model Output**:
     - Predicted probability of being in class 2 (high return) for each stock.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Monthly returns for long and short portfolios.
     - Annualized returns for the strategy.
     - T-statistics for strategy performance.

#### 5. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Training Period**: January 1965 to December 1989.
   - **Test Period**: January 1990 to December 2009.
   - **Rebalancing Frequency**: Monthly.
   - **Portfolio Size**: Top and bottom 10% of stocks based on predicted probabilities.
   - **Performance Benchmark**: Compare against a basic momentum strategy (using past 12-month returns).

#### 6. **Implementation Notes**
   - **Model Training**:
     - Train the stacked autoencoder and FFNN classifier on the training set (1965-1989).
     - Use hold-out cross-validation to determine the optimal network architecture.
   - **Model Testing**:
     - Test the model on the out-of-sample period (1990-2009) without updating model weights.
   - **Computational Considerations**:
     - Use mini-batch training for RBMs and backpropagation for fine-tuning.
     - Consider parallelization or GPU acceleration for faster training.

#### 7. **Expected Output**
   - **Monthly Returns**: Time series of monthly returns for the enhanced momentum strategy.
   - **Annualized Returns**: Annualized return of the strategy over the test period.
   - **Cumulative Wealth**: Growth of $1 invested in the strategy over the test period.
   - **Comparison**: Performance comparison against the basic momentum strategy.
