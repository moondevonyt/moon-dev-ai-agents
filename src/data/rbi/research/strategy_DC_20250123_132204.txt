### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
   - **Timeframe**: Intraday (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts)
   - **Market**: Suitable for liquid markets (e.g., stocks, futures, or forex)
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price deviation from VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Setup**:
     - **Long Entry**: When the price crosses below the VWAP and then reverses back above it, indicating a potential upward mean-reversion.
     - **Short Entry**: When the price crosses above the VWAP and then reverses back below it, indicating a potential downward mean-reversion.
   - **Trend-Following Setup**:
     - **Long Entry**: When the price is consistently above the VWAP and pulls back to the VWAP without breaking below it, indicating a continuation of the uptrend.
     - **Short Entry**: When the price is consistently below the VWAP and rallies to the VWAP without breaking above it, indicating a continuation of the downtrend.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Setup**:
     - **Long Exit**: When the price reaches a predefined profit target (e.g., 1x ATR or fixed percentage) or crosses back below the VWAP.
     - **Short Exit**: When the price reaches a predefined profit target or crosses back above the VWAP.
   - **Trend-Following Setup**:
     - **Long Exit**: When the price closes below the VWAP, indicating a potential trend reversal.
     - **Short Exit**: When the price closes above the VWAP, indicating a potential trend reversal.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place a stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop loss.
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop based on ATR or a fixed percentage to lock in profits during trend-following trades.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price (standard indicator available on most trading platforms).
   - **ATR (Optional)**: Average True Range for setting stop loss and profit targets.
   - **Volume (Optional)**: Confirm entries with high volume spikes for added reliability.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Filter for Market Conditions**:
     - Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events.
   - **Backtesting Parameters**:
     - Test the strategy across different timeframes and asset classes to ensure robustness.
     - Optimize profit targets and stop loss levels based on historical data.

This strategy can be backtested using historical intraday data to evaluate its performance under various market conditions.
