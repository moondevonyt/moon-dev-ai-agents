### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: RSI-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a period of 14 (default setting).
   - **Timeframe**: Use a 1-hour (H1) chart for intraday trading or a daily (D1) chart for swing trading.
   - **Market**: Applicable to any liquid asset (e.g., forex, stocks, crypto).
   - **Objective**: Identify overbought and oversold conditions to generate buy/sell signals.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Buy Signal**: 
     - RSI crosses above 30 (oversold condition).
     - Confirm with price action (e.g., bullish candlestick pattern or trendline breakout).
   - **Sell Signal**: 
     - RSI crosses below 70 (overbought condition).
     - Confirm with price action (e.g., bearish candlestick pattern or trendline breakdown).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**: 
     - Set at a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
     - Alternatively, exit when RSI reaches the opposite threshold (e.g., 70 for a buy trade or 30 for a sell trade).
   - **Stop Loss**: 
     - Place below the recent swing low for buy trades or above the recent swing high for sell trades.
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop loss.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the account balance per trade.
   - **Leverage**: Use low leverage (e.g., 1:5 or 1:10) to minimize risk.
   - **Diversification**: Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or market.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **RSI (14)**: Default settings (period = 14, overbought = 70, oversold = 30).
   - **Optional Confirmation Tools**:
     - Moving Average (e.g., 50-period SMA) to confirm trend direction.
     - Bollinger Bands to identify volatility and potential reversals.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - Avoid trading during low liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, holidays).
   - Backtest the strategy on historical data to validate performance.
   - Adjust RSI thresholds (e.g., 20/80) for more aggressive or conservative trading.
