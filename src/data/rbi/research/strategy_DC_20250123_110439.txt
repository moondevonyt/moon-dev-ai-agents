### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Enhance momentum trading strategies using deep learning.
   - **Model**: Stacked autoencoder composed of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) followed by a feedforward neural network (FFNN) classifier.
   - **Input Data**: 
     - 12 monthly returns (from month t-2 to t-13).
     - 20 daily returns (approximately corresponding to month t).
     - Indicator variable for January (if the holding period falls in January).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Compute cumulative returns for both monthly and daily returns.
     - Normalize cumulative returns using z-scores relative to the cross-section of all stocks for each month or day.
     - Label stocks with returns below the median as class 1 and above the median as class 2.

#### 2. **Entry/Exit Rules**
   - **Entry**:
     - Rank stocks each month based on the predicted probability of being in class 2 (high future returns).
     - Buy stocks in the top decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
     - Sell stocks in the bottom decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
   - **Exit**:
     - Close positions after one month.
     - Re-rank and rebalance the portfolio monthly.

#### 3. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Equal weighting for all stocks in the top and bottom deciles.
   - **Stop-Loss**:
     - Not explicitly mentioned, but the strategy relies on monthly rebalancing to manage risk.
   - **Diversification**:
     - The strategy is applied to a broad universe of stocks (NYSE, AMEX, Nasdaq) with monthly closing prices above $5.

#### 4. **Required Indicators**
   - **Input Indicators**:
     - 12 monthly returns (from month t-2 to t-13).
     - 20 daily returns (approximately corresponding to month t).
     - January indicator variable.
   - **Preprocessing Indicators**:
     - Cumulative returns for both monthly and daily returns.
     - Z-scores for cumulative returns relative to the cross-section of all stocks.
   - **Model Output**:
     - Predicted probability of being in class 2 (high future returns).

#### 5. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Training Period**: January 1965 to December 1989.
   - **Test Period**: January 1990 to December 2009.
   - **Rebalancing Frequency**: Monthly.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Monthly returns for top and bottom deciles.
     - Annualized returns.
     - Cumulative wealth growth.
     - T-statistics for average returns.

#### 6. **Implementation Notes**
   - **Model Training**:
     - Train the stacked autoencoder and FFNN classifier using the training period data.
     - Use hold-out cross-validation to determine the optimal network architecture.
   - **Model Inference**:
     - Use the trained model to predict class probabilities for each stock in the test period.
     - Rank stocks based on predicted probabilities and form portfolios accordingly.
   - **Computational Considerations**:
     - Consider parallel implementation or GPU acceleration for training and inference due to the computational intensity of deep learning models.
