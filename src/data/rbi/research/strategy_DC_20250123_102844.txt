### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: Mastering Market Structure

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Market Structure Identification**: Focus on identifying external swing points (highs and lows) to determine the directional bias (bullish or bearish).
   - **Premium and Discount Zones**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels to identify premium (above 50%) and discount (below 50%) zones within the price leg.
   - **Confluence Areas**: Combine market structure with order blocks or fair value gaps (FVGs) to pinpoint high-probability entry zones.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for directional bias and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entry triggers.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Step 1: Identify Market Structure**
     - Map external swing highs and lows to determine the current trend (bullish or bearish).
     - Bullish Structure: Higher highs and higher lows.
     - Bearish Structure: Lower highs and lower lows.
   - **Step 2: Define Premium and Discount Zones**
     - Use Fibonacci retracement tool from the swing low to swing high.
     - Discount Zone: Below 50% (0.5) retracement level.
     - Premium Zone: Above 50% (0.5) retracement level.
   - **Step 3: Locate Confluence Areas**
     - Look for order blocks or fair value gaps (FVGs) within the discount zone for bullish trades or premium zone for bearish trades.
     - Order Block: A 3-candle formation with aggressive momentum (e.g., bearish move followed by bullish move).
     - Fair Value Gap (FVG): A gap between the wicks of three candles, indicating strong buying or selling pressure.
   - **Step 4: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**
     - On the higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute), wait for price to pull back into the discount zone (bullish) or premium zone (bearish).
     - Switch to the lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) and wait for a structural shift (e.g., bullish reversal for a long trade or bearish reversal for a short trade).
     - Enter the trade when the lower timeframe confirms the reversal in alignment with the higher timeframe bias.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit (TP)**:
     - Target the next external swing high (for bullish trades) or swing low (for bearish trades).
     - Use a 1:5 or 1:7 risk-to-reward ratio for optimal profitability.
     - Close 50% of the position at 1:5 risk-to-reward and let the remaining position run to the full target.
   - **Stop Loss (SL)**:
     - Place the stop loss below the swing low (for bullish trades) or above the swing high (for bearish trades).
     - Alternatively, place the stop loss below the order block or FVG for tighter risk management.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of your account per trade.
     - Example: For a $200,000 account, risk $2,000 per trade.
   - **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum of 1:5 risk-to-reward ratio.
     - Adjust position size to ensure profitability even with a 30% win rate.
   - **Stop Loss Placement**:
     - Always place the stop loss at a logical level (e.g., below the swing low or above the swing high).
     - Avoid placing stop losses inside the price leg to prevent premature exits.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
     - Used to identify premium and discount zones within the price leg.
   - **Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)**:
     - Key confluence areas for high-probability entries.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**:
     - Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for directional bias and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entries.

- Test the strategy on multiple currency pairs and timeframes to ensure robustness.
- Focus on high-probability setups with clear confluence areas (order blocks or FVGs).
- Use historical data to validate the win rate and risk-to-reward ratio.
- Adjust position sizing and risk management based on backtesting results.
