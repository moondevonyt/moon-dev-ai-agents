### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for primary analysis. Weekly charts can be used for additional context. Smaller time frames (5-minute or 15-minute) are only used for order execution.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Used to determine the long-term trend. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm the strength of breakouts and breakdowns.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: A stock breaks through a key resistance level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Breakdown**: A stock breaks below a key support level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Consolidation**: A stock trades within a tight range before a potential breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with:
       - Volume > 500k by midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
       - Positive price movement (>3% on the day).
     - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA and trending along or reclaiming the 8 EMA.
   - **Entry Criteria**:
     - Look for a breakout above a key resistance level that has been tested at least 2-3 times.
     - Enter as close to the 8 EMA as possible after the breakout.
     - Avoid entering at extreme highs; wait for a pullback closer to the 8 EMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 25% at a time) as the stock moves higher.
     - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA.
     - Exit the trade if the stock pulls away significantly from the 8 EMA.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set the stop loss below the 8 EMA.
     - If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the trade immediately.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Always use a stop loss below the 8 EMA to limit potential losses.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Once partial profits are taken, move the stop loss to break-even to protect gains.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **8 EMA**: Momentum indicator for trend direction.
   - **200 SMA**: Long-term trend filter.
   - **Volume**: Confirmation of breakout/breakdown strength.

   - **Step 4: Exit Execution**:
     - Take partial profits as the stock moves higher.
