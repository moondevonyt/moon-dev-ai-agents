### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP + Volume Spike

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: Used as a dynamic support/resistance level.
   - **Volume Spike**: Identifies significant changes in trading volume, indicating potential momentum or reversals.
   - **Price Action**: Confirms entries/exits relative to VWAP and volume spikes.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Long Entry**:
     1. Price crosses above VWAP.
     2. A volume spike occurs (e.g., volume exceeds a predefined threshold, such as 2x the average volume of the last 20 candles).
     3. Confirm with bullish price action (e.g., a bullish engulfing candle or a close above VWAP).
   - **Short Entry**:
     1. Price crosses below VWAP.
     2. A volume spike occurs (e.g., volume exceeds a predefined threshold, such as 2x the average volume of the last 20 candles).
     3. Confirm with bearish price action (e.g., a bearish engulfing candle or a close below VWAP).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) based on the entry price.
     - Alternatively, exit when price crosses back below (for long) or above (for short) VWAP.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place stop loss below the recent swing low (for long) or above the recent swing high (for short).
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1%) or ATR-based stop loss.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the account per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**: Always use a stop loss to limit downside risk.
   - **Trailing Stop**: Optionally, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price.
   - **Volume**: Standard volume indicator.
   - **Volume Spike Threshold**: Custom calculation to identify spikes (e.g., 2x the average volume of the last 20 candles).
   - **Optional**: ATR (Average True Range) for dynamic stop loss placement.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Timeframe**: Suitable for intraday trading (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute, or 1-hour charts).
   - **Market Conditions**: Works best in trending or volatile markets. Avoid ranging or low-volume markets.
   - **Confirmation**: Always wait for price action confirmation after a volume spike to reduce false signals.

These instructions are ready for backtesting. Adjust parameters (e.g., volume spike threshold, risk-reward ratio) based on specific asset characteristics and market conditions.
