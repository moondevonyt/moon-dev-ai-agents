**Strategy Instructions for Backtesting**  

### **1. Key Strategy Components**  
- **Market Structure**:  
  - Identify **external swing points** (higher highs/lows for bullish trends, lower highs/lows for bearish trends).  
  - **Change of Character (ChoCh)**: Shift from bearish to bullish (break of prior swing high) or vice versa (break of prior swing low).  
- **Price Zones**:  
  - **Discount Zone**: Fibonacci retracement levels **below 0.5** (entry zone for bullish trades).  
  - **Premium Zone**: Fibonacci retracement levels **above 0.5** (entry zone for bearish trades).  
- **Confluences**:  
  - **Order Blocks**: 3-candle formation (bearish → bullish → bullish) marking institutional interest.  
  - **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)**: 3-candle formation with a gap between wicks, indicating imbalance.  
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**:  
  - **Higher timeframe (HTF)**: 15M/1H for trend direction and key levels.  
  - **Lower timeframe (LTF)**: 1M/5M for entry triggers.

### **2. Entry Rules**  
#### **Bullish Entry**:  
1. **HTF Setup**:  
   - Confirm **bullish market structure** (higher highs/lows).  
   - Draw Fibonacci retracement (0–100%) from swing low to swing high.  
   - Identify **discount zone** (below 0.5) with confluence (order block/FVG).  
2. **LTF Trigger**:  
   - Wait for price to reach the discount zone.  
   - Confirm **bullish shift** on LTF (break of LTF swing high + pullback).  
   - Enter long at retest of LTF confluence (e.g., FVG/order block).  

#### **Bearish Entry**:  
1. **HTF Setup**:  
   - Confirm **bearish market structure** (lower highs/lows).  
   - Draw Fibonacci retracement (0–100%) from swing high to swing low.  
   - Identify **premium zone** (above 0.5) with confluence (order block/FVG).  
2. **LTF Trigger**:  
   - Wait for price to reach the premium zone.  
   - Confirm **bearish shift** on LTF (break of LTF swing low + pullback).  
   - Enter short at retest of LTF confluence.

### **3. Exit Rules**  
- **Take Profit (TP)**:  
  - **TP1**: Close 50% of position at **5:1 risk-reward** (distance from entry to stop loss × 5).  
  - **TP2**: Trail remaining position to **next HTF swing point** (e.g., prior swing low for bullish trades).  
- **Stop Loss (SL)**:  
  - Place SL **below the LTF confluence** (e.g., below FVG/order block for longs) or **beyond the HTF swing low/high**.  

---

### **4. Risk Management**  
- **Position Sizing**: Risk **1% per trade** (e.g., $1,000 risk on a $100,000 account).  
- **SL Placement**:  
  - For longs: SL below LTF confluence or HTF swing low.  
  - For shorts: SL above LTF confluence or HTF swing high.  
- **Avoid Internal Structure Traps**: Only trade external swing breaks confirmed by ChoCh.

### **5. Required Indicators**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: To define discount/premium zones.  
2. **Order Blocks**: Marked as 3-candle reversal patterns on HTF.  
3. **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)**: Identified as 3-candle imbalances on HTF/LTF.  
4. **Swing Points**: Manually marked external highs/lows.

**Backtest Execution Logic**:  
1. Filter trades by HTF trend and ChoCh.  
2. Trigger entries only in discount/premium zones with LTF confirmation.  
3. Validate SL/TP rules and risk-reward ratios.  
4. Track performance metrics (win rate, max drawdown, profit factor).
