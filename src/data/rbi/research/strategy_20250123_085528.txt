### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for broader context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Used to determine the long-term trend. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm breakout strength and momentum.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: Stock breaks above a key resistance level.
     - **Breakdown**: Stock breaks below a key support level.
     - **Consolidation**: Stock trades within a tight range before a potential breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with:
       - Volume > 500k during midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
       - Positive price movement (>3% on the day).
     - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA.
   - **Technical Setup**:
     - Look for stocks trending along the 8 EMA with a history of reclaiming the 8 EMA after pullbacks.
     - Identify key resistance levels that have been tested multiple times (at least 2-3 times).
   - **Entry Point**:
     - Enter as close to the 8 EMA as possible after a breakout above resistance.
     - Avoid entering at extended levels far from the 8 EMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 25% at first breakout, another 25% at the next significant move).
     - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place the stop loss below the 8 EMA.
     - Exit the trade if the stock closes below the 8 EMA.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Always use a stop loss below the 8 EMA to limit losses.
   - **Partial Profit Taking**:
     - Take partial profits at key breakout levels to lock in gains and reduce risk.
