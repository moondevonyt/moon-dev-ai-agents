### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Use intraday data (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Market**: Suitable for liquid markets with consistent volume (e.g., stocks, futures, or forex).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price interaction with VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Entry**:
     - Buy when the price crosses **below** the VWAP and then **re-crosses above** it, indicating a potential upward reversal.
     - Sell when the price crosses **above** the VWAP and then **re-crosses below** it, indicating a potential downward reversal.
   - **Trend-Following Entry**:
     - Buy when the price is **above** the VWAP and continues to move upward, confirming a bullish trend.
     - Sell when the price is **below** the VWAP and continues to move downward, confirming a bearish trend.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Fixed Profit Target**: Exit the trade when the price reaches a predefined profit target (e.g., 1% or 2% above/below the entry price).
   - **Fixed Stop Loss**: Exit the trade if the price moves against the position by a predefined percentage (e.g., 0.5% or 1%).
   - **VWAP Reversal Exit**: Exit the trade if the price re-crosses the VWAP in the opposite direction of the trade.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the account balance per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**: Use a fixed stop loss based on the volatility of the asset (e.g., ATR-based stop or percentage-based stop).
   - **Take Profit**: Use a fixed take profit level or a trailing stop to lock in gains.
   - **Maximum Daily Loss**: Set a daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of the account balance) to prevent over-trading.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Calculate the VWAP using the formula:
     \[
     \text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Price} \times \text{Volume})}{\sum \text{Volume}}
     \]
   - **Optional Confirmation Indicators**:
     - Moving Averages (e.g., 9-period EMA) to confirm trends.
     - RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
     - Volume Profile to confirm significant support/resistance levels.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Time Period**: Test over multiple market conditions (e.g., trending, ranging, volatile).
   - **Asset Selection**: Test on a diverse set of liquid assets.
   - **Slippage and Commissions**: Include realistic slippage and commission costs.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate win rate, profit factor, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

#### 7. **Optimization**
   - Test different timeframes (e.g., 1-minute vs. 5-minute) to find the optimal setting.
   - Adjust profit targets and stop-loss levels to balance risk and reward.
   - Incorporate additional filters (e.g., volume spikes, news events) to improve strategy performance.
