### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for additional context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Used to determine the long-term trend. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm breakouts and breakdowns. Look for increased volume during key price movements.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: A stock breaks through a key resistance level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Breakdown**: A stock breaks below a key support level after testing it multiple times.
     - **Consolidation**: A stock trades within a tight range before a potential breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with the following criteria:
       - Price > $1 per share.
       - Volume > 500k during the middle of the day (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
       - Stock is up at least 3% on the day.
     - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA and trending along the 8 EMA.
   - **Entry Conditions**:
     - Look for a breakout above a key resistance level that has been tested at least 2-3 times.
     - Enter the trade as close to the 8 EMA as possible, ideally during a pullback to the 8 EMA.
     - Confirm the breakout with increased volume.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 1/4 of the position) as the stock moves higher and pulls away from the 8 EMA.
     - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA, selling another 1/4 at key resistance levels.
     - Keep at least half of the position to continue trailing the 8 EMA until a significant breakdown occurs.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set the stop loss below the 8 EMA. If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the trade.
     - Once partial profits are taken, move the stop loss to break-even.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
     - Adjust position size based on the distance between the entry price and the stop loss level.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Avoid over-concentration in a single stock or sector. Spread risk across multiple trades.
   - **Trade Frequency**:
     - Focus on quality over quantity. Take only high-probability setups that meet all criteria.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **8 EMA**: Momentum indicator for identifying trend direction.
   - **200 SMA**: Long-term trend filter. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
   - **Volume**: Confirmation of breakouts and breakdowns.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Time Period**: Test the strategy over at least 1-2 years of historical data.
   - **Market Conditions**: Include both bullish and bearish market conditions to assess strategy robustness.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Win rate (percentage of winning trades).
     - Average profit per trade.
     - Average loss per trade.
     - Risk-reward ratio.
     - Maximum drawdown.
   - **Trade Execution**:
     - Simulate real-world conditions by including slippage and commission costs.
     - Use daily closing prices for backtesting to avoid intraday noise.

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - **Watchlist Management**:
     - Maintain a watchlist of potential swing trading candidates that meet the criteria but are not yet ready for entry.
     - Re-evaluate these stocks periodically for potential setups.
   - **Brokerage**:
     - Use brokers that support bracket orders and OCO (One Cancels the Other) orders for managing entries and exits.
     - Recommended brokers: Interactive Brokers, Centerpoint Securities, or Weeble.
