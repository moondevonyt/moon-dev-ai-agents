### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### **1. Key Strategy Components**
- **Objective**: Capture multi-day to multi-week price movements by identifying breakouts and riding the trend using technical analysis.
- **Focus**: Large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with high liquidity (volume > 500k).
- **Timeframe**: Daily and weekly charts for analysis; 5-minute or 15-minute charts for execution.
- **Indicators**:
  - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Momentum indicator to identify uptrends and breakouts.
  - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Long-term trend filter; only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
  - **Volume**: Confirms breakout strength and momentum.

#### **2. Entry Rules**
1. **Stock Selection**:
   - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (>$1 billion market cap) with:
     - Price > $1 per share.
     - Volume > 500k by midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
     - Positive price movement (>3% on the day).
   - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA on the daily chart.

2. **Chart Pattern Analysis**:
   - Look for **breakout patterns**:
     - Stock must break above a key resistance level that has been tested at least 2-3 times.
     - Stock should be trending along or reclaiming the 8 EMA.
   - Avoid stocks below the 200 SMA or those in a downtrend.

3. **Entry Point**:
   - Enter as close to the 8 EMA as possible after a breakout.
   - Ideal entry is during a pullback to the 8 EMA after the initial breakout.
   - Avoid chasing breakouts far above the 8 EMA.

#### **3. Exit Rules**
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 25% at a time) as the stock moves higher.
   - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA.
   - Exit fully if the stock shows signs of reversal (e.g., breaks below the 8 EMA or loses momentum).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Set the stop loss below the 8 EMA.
   - If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the trade.

#### **4. Risk Management**
- **Position Sizing**:
  - Risk no more than 1-2% of your account per trade.
  - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
- **Diversification**:
  - Avoid over-concentration in a single stock or sector.
- **Stop Loss Discipline**:
  - Always adhere to the stop loss below the 8 EMA to limit losses.

#### **5. Required Indicators**
1. **8 EMA**:
   - Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
   - Acts as a dynamic support level for entries and exits.
2. **200 SMA**:
   - Filters out weak stocks; only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
3. **Volume**:
   - Confirms breakout strength; higher volume increases the likelihood of a sustained move.

#### **6. Backtesting Steps**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical daily and weekly price data for large-cap stocks.
   - Ensure data includes volume and moving averages (8 EMA, 200 SMA).

2. **Scan for Breakouts**:
   - Identify stocks that broke above key resistance levels with volume confirmation.
   - Ensure the stock was above the 200 SMA at the time of the breakout.

3. **Simulate Entries**:
   - Enter trades as close to the 8 EMA as possible after a breakout.
   - Record entry price, stop loss, and position size.

4. **Simulate Exits**:
   - Sell in partial sizes as the stock moves higher.
   - Exit fully if the stock closes below the 8 EMA.

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - Calculate win rate, average profit/loss per trade, and risk-reward ratio.
   - Identify patterns in winning and losing trades to refine the strategy.
