### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Timeframe**: Use **daily charts** for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for broader context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Momentum indicator to identify uptrends and breakouts.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Long-term trend filter. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Confirms breakout strength and momentum.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: Stock breaks above a key resistance level after multiple tests.
     - **Breakdown**: Stock breaks below a key support level after multiple tests.
     - **Consolidation**: Stock trades within a tight range before a breakout or breakdown.
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Focus on **large-cap stocks** (market cap > $1 billion).
     - Avoid penny stocks or small-cap stocks.
     - Use a scanner to identify stocks with **volume > 500k** and **price movement > 3%** during midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
