### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Enhance momentum trading strategies using deep learning.
   - **Model**: Stacked autoencoder composed of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) followed by a feedforward neural network (FFNN) classifier.
   - **Input Data**: 
     - 12 monthly returns (months t-2 to t-13).
     - 20 daily returns (approximately corresponding to month t).
     - Indicator variable for January (if the holding period falls in January).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Compute cumulative returns for both monthly and daily returns.
     - Normalize cumulative returns using z-scores relative to the cross-section of all stocks for each month/day.
     - Label stocks with returns below the median as class 1 and above the median as class 2.

#### 2. **Entry/Exit Rules**
   - **Entry**:
     - Each month, rank all stocks by their predicted class 2 probability (probability of being in the top return class).
     - Buy stocks in the top decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
     - Sell (short) stocks in the bottom decile (10%) of predicted class 2 probabilities.
   - **Exit**:
     - Close all positions at the end of the holding period (one month).
     - Repeat the ranking and portfolio formation process each month.

#### 3. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Equal weighting for all stocks in the top and bottom deciles.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - No explicit stop-loss rule is mentioned in the strategy. However, the monthly rebalancing inherently limits exposure to any single stock.
   - **Diversification**:
     - The strategy is applied to a broad universe of stocks (average of 3,282 stocks per month), ensuring diversification across sectors and market caps.

#### 4. **Required Indicators**
   - **Input Indicators**:
     - 12 monthly returns (months t-2 to t-13).
     - 20 daily returns (approximately corresponding to month t).
     - January indicator variable.
   - **Preprocessing Indicators**:
     - Cumulative returns for both monthly and daily returns.
     - Z-scores for cumulative returns (normalized relative to the cross-section of all stocks).
   - **Model Output**:
     - Predicted class 2 probability for each stock (probability of being in the top return class).

#### 5. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Training Period**: January 1965 to December 1989.
   - **Test Period**: January 1990 to December 2009.
   - **Rebalancing Frequency**: Monthly.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Monthly returns for the top and bottom deciles.
     - Annualized returns.
     - T-statistics for strategy returns.
     - Cumulative wealth growth over the test period.

#### 6. **Implementation Notes**
   - **Model Training**:
     - Train the stacked autoencoder and FFNN classifier using the training period data.
     - Use hold-out cross-validation to determine the optimal network architecture (e.g., 33-40-4-50-2).
   - **Model Testing**:
     - Apply the trained model to the test period data to generate monthly predictions.
     - Form portfolios based on the predicted class 2 probabilities and calculate returns.
   - **Computational Considerations**:
     - The strategy involves significant computational resources, especially for training the deep learning model.
     - Consider using GPUs or parallel processing to reduce training time.

#### 7. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Compare the enhanced momentum strategy (using deep learning) with a basic momentum strategy (based on past 12-month returns).
   - Evaluate the strategy based on:
     - Annualized returns.
     - Sharpe ratio or other risk-adjusted performance metrics.
     - Drawdowns and volatility.
     - Cumulative wealth growth over the test period.

#### 8. **Additional Considerations**
   - **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding additional features such as industry returns, firm characteristics, or macroeconomic indicators.
   - **Model Updating**: Explore updating the model weights periodically (e.g., annually) to adapt to changing market conditions.
   - **Transaction Costs**: Account for transaction costs and slippage in the backtest to assess the strategy's feasibility in a real-world trading environment.
