### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for broader context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Momentum indicator to identify uptrends and breakouts.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Long-term trend filter. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Confirms breakout strength and momentum.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: Stock breaks above a key resistance level after multiple tests.
     - **Breakdown**: Stock breaks below a key support level after multiple tests.
     - **Consolidation**: Stock trades within a tight range before a breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to identify large-cap stocks (>$1 billion market cap) with:
       - Volume > 500k by midday.
       - Positive price movement (>3% on the day).
       - Above the 200 SMA.
     - Look for stocks trending along or reclaiming the 8 EMA.
   - **Entry Conditions**:
     - Stock must break above a key resistance level (confirmed by volume).
     - Enter as close to the 8 EMA as possible after the breakout.
     - Avoid entering during extended moves away from the 8 EMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 25% at first breakout, 25% at next significant move, and trail the remaining 50% along the 8 EMA).
     - Exit fully if the stock closes below the 8 EMA.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set stop loss below the 8 EMA.
     - Move stop loss to break-even after taking partial profits.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your account per trade.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Avoid over-concentration in a single stock or sector.
   - **Trade Frequency**:
     - Focus on quality setups rather than quantity. Be selective and patient.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **8 EMA**: Momentum and trend confirmation.
   - **200 SMA**: Long-term trend filter.
   - **Volume**: Confirms breakout strength and momentum.

#### 6. **Backtesting Setup**
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Daily and weekly price data for large-cap stocks.
     - Volume data for confirmation.
   - **Backtesting Parameters**:
     - Test the strategy on historical data for at least 1-2 years.
     - Include multiple market conditions (bullish, bearish, sideways).
   - **Metrics to Track**:
     - Win rate.
     - Average profit per trade.
     - Average loss per trade.
     - Risk-reward ratio.
     - Maximum drawdown.

#### 7. **Execution Notes**
   - Use a broker that supports bracket orders or OCO (One Cancels the Other) orders for automated stop loss and take profit management.
   - Keep a trading journal to document each trade, including entry/exit points, rationale, and lessons learned.

#### 8. **Additional Tips**
   - Avoid trading during earnings or major news events unless the setup is exceptionally strong.
