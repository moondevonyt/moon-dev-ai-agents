### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Market Structure Identification**: Identify external swing highs and lows to determine the directional bias (bullish or bearish).
   - **Premium and Discount Zones**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels to define premium (above 50%) and discount (below 50%) zones.
   - **Confluence Areas**: Identify order blocks or fair value gaps within the discount zone for high-probability entries.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Use a higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute) for overall market structure and a lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entry triggers.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Step 1: Identify Market Structure**
     - Mark external swing highs and lows.
     - Confirm bullish structure (higher highs and higher lows) or bearish structure (lower highs and lower lows).
   - **Step 2: Define Premium and Discount Zones**
     - Use Fibonacci retracement tool from the most recent swing low to swing high.
     - Discount zone: Below 50% retracement level.
   - **Step 3: Locate Confluence Areas**
     - Identify order blocks or fair value gaps within the discount zone.
     - Order Block: A three-candle formation with aggressive momentum.
     - Fair Value Gap: A gap between the wicks of three candles indicating strong buying or selling pressure.
   - **Step 4: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**
     - Wait for price to enter the discount zone and confluence area on the higher timeframe.
     - Switch to the lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) and wait for a structural shift (e.g., bullish reversal for a long trade).
     - Enter the trade when the lower timeframe confirms the reversal.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**: Target the next external swing high (for long trades) or swing low (for short trades).
   - **Partial Profit**: Close 50% of the position at a 5:1 risk-reward ratio.
   - **Stop Loss**: Place the stop loss below the confluence area (e.g., below the order block or fair value gap).

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Risk per Trade**: Risk no more than 1% of the account per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum of 1:2 risk-reward ratio, with potential for higher ratios (e.g., 1:5 or 1:7).
   - **Stop Loss Placement**: Place the stop loss below the confluence area to minimize risk.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: To define premium and discount zones.
   - **Price Action**: To identify swing highs, swing lows, order blocks, and fair value gaps.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Use a higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute) for market structure and a lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) for entry confirmation.

#### 6. **Trade Execution Example**
   - **Bullish Trade**:
     1. Identify a higher high and higher low on the 15-minute chart.
     2. Draw Fibonacci retracement from the swing low to the swing high.
     3. Locate an order block or fair value gap within the discount zone.
     4. Switch to the 1-minute chart and wait for a bullish reversal pattern.
     5. Enter the trade at the confluence area with a stop loss below the order block.
     6. Target the next swing high for take profit.
   - **Bearish Trade**:
     1. Identify a lower high and lower low on the 15-minute chart.
     2. Draw Fibonacci retracement from the swing high to the swing low.
     3. Locate an order block or fair value gap within the premium zone.
     4. Switch to the 1-minute chart and wait for a bearish reversal pattern.
     5. Enter the trade at the confluence area with a stop loss above the order block.
     6. Target the next swing low for take profit.

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - **Change of Character**: If a swing high or low is broken, it indicates a potential shift in market structure. Adjust the directional bias accordingly.
   - **Internal vs. External Structure**: Avoid trading internal price movements; focus on external breakouts for higher accuracy.
   - **Trade Refinement**: Use multi-timeframe analysis to refine entries and improve risk-reward ratios.

This strategy combines market structure, Fibonacci levels, confluence areas, and multi-timeframe analysis to provide high-probability trading opportunities with controlled risk.
