### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: Mean Reversion with 2B Pattern

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Identify overextended price moves using bands/channels and trade reversals using the 2B pattern.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Keltner Channels (20-period, ATR multiplier of 2.5) or Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).
     - Candlestick patterns (e.g., bearish engulfing, reversal candles).
   - **Timeframe**: Daily charts (adjustable for other timeframes).
   - **Instruments**: Stocks, forex, or other assets with sufficient liquidity and volatility.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Step 1: Identify Overextension**:
     - Price must close or pierce outside the upper or lower Keltner Channel/Bollinger Band.
     - Momentum should be present (e.g., a strong price move over several days).
   - **Step 2: Wait for Pullback**:
     - After the overextension, wait for a small retracement (pullback) where price takes out some candle lows (for long setups) or highs (for short setups).
   - **Step 3: 2B Pattern Confirmation**:
     - Price must break the recent high (for short setups) or low (for long setups) and then reverse.
     - Look for a reversal candlestick (e.g., bearish engulfing, doji, or pin bar) at the point of reversal.
   - **Step 4: Enter Trade**:
     - For short setups: Place a sell stop order below the low of the reversal candle.
     - For long setups: Place a buy stop order above the high of the reversal candle.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place the stop loss just beyond the high of the reversal candle (for short setups) or the low of the reversal candle (for long setups).
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Target the mean (e.g., the 20-period moving average or the middle line of the Keltner Channel/Bollinger Band).
     - Alternatively, use a risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the stop loss distance.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Consider using a trailing stop to lock in profits if the price moves favorably.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Use half of your normal position size for these trades due to the higher likelihood of initial stop-outs.
     - Allocate no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - **Multiple Entries**:
     - If the first trade is stopped out, wait for the setup to reoccur and enter again with the remaining half of your position size.
   - **Avoid Overtrading**:
     - Only trade setups that meet all criteria (overextension, pullback, 2B pattern, and reversal confirmation).

     - Period: 20
     - ATR Multiplier: 2.5
   - **Bollinger Bands**:
     - Period: 20
     - Standard Deviations: 2

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Scanning for Setups**:
     - Use a screener to identify overbought/oversold conditions or instruments piercing bands/channels.
   - **Trade Management**:
     - Be prepared for price to retest the bands/channels after the initial reversal.
     - Lock in profits aggressively during trend moves.
   - **Backtesting**:
     - Test the strategy on historical data across multiple instruments and timeframes to validate its effectiveness.
     - Adjust parameters (e.g., ATR multiplier, stop loss distance) based on backtest results.
