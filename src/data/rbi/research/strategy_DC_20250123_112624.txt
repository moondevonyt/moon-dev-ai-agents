### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP + Mean Reversion

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: Used as a dynamic support/resistance level.
   - **Mean Reversion**: Assumes price will revert to the VWAP after deviating significantly.
   - **Timeframe**: Suitable for intraday trading (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Asset**: Works best with liquid assets (e.g., stocks, forex, or crypto).

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Long Entry**:
     1. Price must be below the VWAP.
     2. Price must deviate from the VWAP by a predefined threshold (e.g., 1% or 2% below VWAP).
     3. Wait for a bullish reversal candlestick pattern (e.g., hammer, engulfing) or a momentum indicator (e.g., RSI < 30) to confirm the entry.
   - **Short Entry**:
     1. Price must be above the VWAP.
     2. Price must deviate from the VWAP by a predefined threshold (e.g., 1% or 2% above VWAP).
     3. Wait for a bearish reversal candlestick pattern (e.g., shooting star, bearish engulfing) or a momentum indicator (e.g., RSI > 70) to confirm the entry.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     1. Set a target at the VWAP level.
     2. Alternatively, use a fixed percentage profit target (e.g., 0.5% or 1%).
   - **Stop Loss**:
     1. Place a stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
     2. Alternatively, use a fixed percentage stop loss (e.g., 1% or 2%).
   - **Time-Based Exit**:
     1. Exit the trade if the price does not revert to the VWAP within a predefined time window (e.g., 30 minutes or 1 hour).

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     1. Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
     2. Calculate position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
   - **Maximum Daily Loss**:
     1. Stop trading for the day if the total loss exceeds 5% of the trading capital.
   - **Maximum Daily Trades**:
     1. Limit the number of trades per day to avoid overtrading (e.g., 5 trades per day).

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price (standard indicator available on most platforms).
   - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Optional for confirming overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **Candlestick Patterns**: For identifying reversal signals.
   - **ATR (Average True Range)**: Optional for setting dynamic stop loss levels.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Timeframe**: Intraday (1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute).
   - **Data Range**: At least 3 months of historical data for robust results.
   - **Deviation Threshold**: Test multiple thresholds (e.g., 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%) to find the optimal value.
   - **Profit Target/Stop Loss**: Test fixed percentages (e.g., 0.5%, 1%) and dynamic levels (e.g., VWAP, swing highs/lows).
   - **Slippage and Fees**: Include realistic slippage and trading fees in the backtest.

#### 7. **Optimization**
   - Test different combinations of:
     1. Deviation thresholds.
     2. Time-based exit windows.
     3. RSI levels for confirmation.
     4. Position sizing rules.
