### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: "Secret Sculpting Strategy"

---

#### **1. Key Strategy Components**
- **Timeframes**: 
  - Higher timeframe (HTF): 15-minute chart (for trend and liquidity analysis).
  - Lower timeframe (LTF): 5-minute or 1-minute chart (for precise entry execution).
- **Trend Identification**: Determine if the market is bullish or bearish on the HTF.
- **Market Phases**: Identify if price is in a continuation phase or pullback phase.
- **Liquidity Analysis**: Locate available liquidity (above swing highs in bearish scenarios, below swing lows in bullish scenarios).
- **Entry Model**: Use the "Flip + Sweep" entry model to confirm trades.

#### **2. Entry Rules**
**Bullish Scenario**:
1. **HTF Analysis**:
   - Confirm a bullish trend on the 15-minute chart.
   - Identify a breakout structure and anticipate a pullback.
   - Locate available liquidity below the last swing low.
2. **LTF Execution**:
   - Drop to the 5-minute chart when price pulls back to the extreme demand zone (last line of defense).
   - Wait for a liquidity sweep (sharp V-shaped reaction) below the swing low.
   - Look for a "Flip + Sweep" zone:
     - Price reacts from a supply zone but fails to take out the low (flip zone).
     - Wait for price to sweep liquidity below the flip zone.
   - Confirm a market shift (price closes above the last internal high).
   - Enter long when price pulls back to the flip + sweep zone.
   - Place stop loss below the flip + sweep zone.
   - Target 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio.

**Bearish Scenario**:
1. **HTF Analysis**:
   - Confirm a bearish trend on the 15-minute chart.
   - Identify a breakdown structure and anticipate a pullback.
   - Locate available liquidity above the last swing high.
2. **LTF Execution**:
   - Drop to the 5-minute chart when price pulls back to the extreme supply zone.
   - Wait for a liquidity sweep (sharp V-shaped reaction) above the swing high.
   - Look for a "Flip + Sweep" zone:
     - Price reacts from a demand zone but fails to take out the high (flip zone).
     - Wait for price to sweep liquidity above the flip zone.
   - Confirm a market shift (price closes below the last internal low).
   - Enter short when price pulls back to the flip + sweep zone.
   - Place stop loss above the flip + sweep zone.
   - Target 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio.

#### **3. Exit Rules**
- **Take Profit**: Exit at 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio.
- **Stop Loss**: Place stop loss below the flip + sweep zone (bullish) or above the flip + sweep zone (bearish).
- **Market Shift Failure**: If price fails to confirm a market shift, avoid entering the trade.

---

#### **4. Risk Management**
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of your account per trade.
- **Stop Loss Placement**: Always place stop loss below/above the flip + sweep zone.
- **Avoid Overtrading**: Only enter trades when all criteria (liquidity sweep, flip + sweep, market shift) are met.
- **Beginner Caution**: Stick to the 5-minute chart; avoid the 1-minute chart unless experienced.

---

#### **5. Required Indicators**
- **No Indicators Needed**: This is a price action-based strategy. Use only:
  - Swing highs and lows for liquidity zones.
  - Supply and demand zones for entry areas.
  - Candlestick patterns for confirmation (e.g., V-shaped reactions).

---

#### **6. Additional Notes**
- **Patience is Key**: Wait for all criteria to align before entering a trade.
- **Avoid Early Entries**: Do not enter trades based solely on the near demand/supply zone; wait for the extreme zone.
- **Refinement**: Advanced traders can refine entries using the 1-minute chart for sniper-like precision.
