### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Trend Identification**: Use moving averages to identify the overall market trend.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**: Utilize the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm momentum.
   - **Volatility Filter**: Apply the Average True Range (ATR) to filter out low-volatility conditions.
   - **Entry Signals**: Combine trend, momentum, and volatility signals to generate entry points.
   - **Exit Signals**: Use trailing stops and take-profit levels based on ATR.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Long Entry**:
     1. **Trend Condition**: The 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) must be above the 200-period SMA.
     2. **Momentum Condition**: RSI must be above 50 but below 70 (to avoid overbought conditions).
     3. **Volatility Condition**: ATR must be above a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the average ATR over the last 14 periods).
     4. **Price Action**: Enter a long position when the price closes above the 50-period SMA.
   - **Short Entry**:
     1. **Trend Condition**: The 50-period SMA must be below the 200-period SMA.
     2. **Momentum Condition**: RSI must be below 50 but above 30 (to avoid oversold conditions).
     3. **Volatility Condition**: ATR must be above the same predefined threshold.
     4. **Price Action**: Enter a short position when the price closes below the 50-period SMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take-Profit**:
     - Set a take-profit level at 2 times the ATR value at the time of entry.
   - **Stop-Loss**:
     - Set a stop-loss at 1 times the ATR value at the time of entry.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop based on the ATR. Adjust the stop-loss to 1 times the ATR below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the highest/lowest price reached since entry.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of the total account equity on any single trade.
     - Calculate position size based on the stop-loss distance and the 1% risk rule.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**:
     - Set a maximum drawdown limit of 10% of the account equity. If reached, stop trading and reassess the strategy.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Limit exposure to any single asset to 5% of the total account equity.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**:
     - 50-period SMA
     - 200-period SMA
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
     - 14-period RSI
   - **Average True Range (ATR)**:
     - 14-period ATR

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Timeframe**: Daily or 4-hour charts.
   - **Data Range**: At least 5 years of historical data.
   - **Commission and Slippage**: Include a fixed commission per trade and a slippage factor of 0.1% of the trade value.
   - **Initial Capital**: $10,000 (adjustable based on backtesting results).

#### 7. **Performance Metrics to Track**
   - **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning trades.
   - **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Average reward per trade divided by average risk per trade.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline in account equity.
   - **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return.
   - **Profit Factor**: Gross profits divided by gross losses.
