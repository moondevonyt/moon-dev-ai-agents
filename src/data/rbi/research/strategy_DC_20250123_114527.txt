     2. Exit when the price reaches the target profit level.
   - **Stop Loss**:

     2. Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop loss.

     1. Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
     2. Calculate position size based on stop loss distance.
   - **Maximum Daily Loss**:
     1. Set a daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of capital).
     2. Stop trading for the day if the limit is reached.
   - **Diversification**:
     1. Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or sector.

     4. Risk-reward ratio.

   - Adjust stop loss and take profit levels.
   - Experiment with additional filters (e.g., RSI thresholds or volume spikes).
