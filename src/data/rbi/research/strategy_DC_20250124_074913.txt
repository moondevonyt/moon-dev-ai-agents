### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Trend Identification**: Use a combination of moving averages to identify the overall market trend.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**: Utilize the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm momentum before entering a trade.
   - **Volatility Filter**: Apply the Average True Range (ATR) to filter out low-volatility conditions.
   - **Entry Signals**: Look for specific candlestick patterns or price action signals that align with the trend and momentum.
   - **Exit Signals**: Use trailing stops or predefined profit targets based on ATR multiples.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Trend Confirmation**: 
     - Use a 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
     - Enter a long position if the 50 EMA is above the 200 SMA, indicating an uptrend.
     - Enter a short position if the 50 EMA is below the 200 SMA, indicating a downtrend.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**:
     - RSI should be above 50 for a long entry and below 50 for a short entry.
   - **Volatility Filter**:
     - Ensure that the ATR is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 1% of the asset's price) to avoid low-volatility conditions.
   - **Candlestick Pattern**:
     - For a long entry, look for a bullish engulfing pattern or a hammer candle.
     - For a short entry, look for a bearish engulfing pattern or a shooting star candle.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Profit Target**:
     - Set a profit target at 2x the ATR value from the entry price.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop set at 1x the ATR value from the highest price reached since entry (for long positions) or the lowest price reached since entry (for short positions).
   - **Time-Based Exit**:
     - Exit the trade if the profit target or trailing stop is not hit within 5 trading days.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of the total trading capital on any single trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set a stop loss at 1x the ATR value from the entry price.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
   - **200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
   - **Average True Range (ATR)**

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Timeframe**: Daily charts.
   - **Asset**: Any liquid asset (e.g., stocks, forex, commodities).
   - **Data Range**: At least 5 years of historical data.
   - **Commission**: Include a standard commission fee (e.g., $5 per trade).
   - **Slippage**: Assume a slippage of 0.1% of the asset's price.

These instructions should provide a clear framework for backtesting the strategy.
