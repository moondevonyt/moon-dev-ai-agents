### Swing Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Time Frame**: Use daily charts for analysis and execution. Weekly charts can be used for broader context.
   - **Indicators**:
     - **8 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify momentum and trend direction.
     - **200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Used to determine the long-term trend. Only trade stocks above the 200 SMA.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm breakouts and breakdowns.
   - **Chart Patterns**:
     - **Breakout**: Stock breaks above a key resistance level.
     - **Breakdown**: Stock breaks below a key support level.
     - **Consolidation**: Stock trades within a tight range before a breakout or breakdown.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Stock Selection**:
     - Use a scanner to find large-cap stocks (market cap > $1 billion) with volume > 500k and positive price movement (>3%) during midday (after 11:00 AM Eastern Time).
     - Ensure the stock is above the 200 SMA and trending along or reclaiming the 8 EMA.
   - **Entry Criteria**:
     - Look for stocks breaking out of a key resistance level on the daily chart.
     - Enter as close to the 8 EMA as possible after a breakout.
     - Ensure the stock has a history of reclaiming the 8 EMA after pullbacks.
   - **Example Entry**:
     - If a stock breaks out of a resistance level at $190 and is trending along the 8 EMA, enter near the 8 EMA (e.g., $185-$190).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Sell in partial sizes (e.g., 1/4 of the position) as the stock moves higher, especially when it pulls away from the 8 EMA.
     - Trail the remaining position along the 8 EMA.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set the stop loss below the 8 EMA. If the stock closes below the 8 EMA, exit the position.
   - **Example Exit**:
     - If the stock breaks out and moves from $190 to $220, sell 1/4 at $200, another 1/4 at $210, and trail the remaining half along the 8 EMA.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Always use a stop loss below the 8 EMA to limit losses.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or better.

   - **8 EMA**: Momentum indicator for trend direction.
   - **200 SMA**: Long-term trend filter.
