### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Use intraday data (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Market**: Applicable to any liquid asset (stocks, forex, crypto, etc.).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price interaction with VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Bullish Entry**:
     - Price crosses above VWAP.
     - Volume should be above the average volume of the last 20 periods.
     - Optional: Confirm with a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., engulfing, hammer).
   - **Bearish Entry**:
     - Price crosses below VWAP.
     - Volume should be above the average volume of the last 20 periods.
     - Optional: Confirm with a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., shooting star, bearish engulfing).

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a fixed percentage or point-based target (e.g., 1% or 10 pips).
     - Alternatively, exit when price reverts to VWAP.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or point-based stop (e.g., 0.5% or 5 pips).
   - **Time-Based Exit**:
     - Exit the trade if the target or stop is not hit within a predefined time window (e.g., 30 minutes or 1 hour).

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of the account balance per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio.
   - **Max Daily Loss**:
     - Stop trading for the day if the account loses a predefined percentage (e.g., 5%).

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price.
   - **Volume**: To confirm entry signals.
   - **Optional**:
     - Moving Average (e.g., 20-period SMA) for additional trend confirmation.
     - RSI or MACD for divergence/convergence signals.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Data**: Use at least 3 months of intraday historical data.
   - **Timeframe**: Test on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute).
   - **Market Conditions**: Test in trending, ranging, and volatile markets.
   - **Metrics to Track**:
     - Win rate.
     - Average profit/loss per trade.
     - Maximum drawdown.
     - Risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio).

#### 7. **Optimization**
   - Adjust the following parameters:
     - Volume threshold for entry confirmation.
     - Stop loss and take profit levels.
     - Time-based exit window.
   - Avoid overfitting by testing on out-of-sample data.

#### 8. **Execution**
   - Use a backtesting platform that supports VWAP and volume-based strategies.
   - Ensure slippage and commission are accounted for in the backtest.
