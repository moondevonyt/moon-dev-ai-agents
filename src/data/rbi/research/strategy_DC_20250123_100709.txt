### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: Mastering Market Structure

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Market Structure Identification**: Identify external swing points (highs and lows) to determine the directional bias (bullish or bearish).
   - **Premium and Discount Zones**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels to define premium (above 50%) and discount (below 50%) zones within a price leg.
   - **Confluence Areas**: Combine market structure with order blocks or fair value gaps (FVGs) to identify high-probability entry zones.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for directional bias and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entry triggers.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Step 1: Identify Market Structure**
     - Map external swing highs and lows to determine the trend (bullish or bearish).
     - Bullish Structure: Higher highs and higher lows.
     - Bearish Structure: Lower highs and lower lows.
   - **Step 2: Define Premium and Discount Zones**
     - Use Fibonacci retracement tool from the swing low to swing high.
     - Discount Zone: Below 50% retracement (preferred for entries).
     - Premium Zone: Above 50% retracement (preferred for exits).
   - **Step 3: Locate Confluence Areas**
     - Look for order blocks or fair value gaps (FVGs) within the discount zone.
     - Order Block: A 3-candle formation with aggressive momentum (e.g., bearish-bullish-bullish).
     - Fair Value Gap: A gap between the wicks of three candles (e.g., bullish-bullish-bullish).
   - **Step 4: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**
     - On the higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute), wait for price to pull back into the discount zone and confluence area.
     - Switch to the lower timeframe (e.g., 1-minute) and wait for a structural shift (e.g., bullish reversal for a long trade).
     - Enter the trade when the lower timeframe confirms the reversal.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit Targets**:
     - Primary Target: The next external swing high (for bullish trades) or swing low (for bearish trades).
     - Secondary Target: Use a risk-reward ratio of 1:5 or higher. Close 50% of the position at 5x risk and let the remaining position run to the full target.
   - **Stop Loss Placement**:
     - Place the stop loss below the confluence area (e.g., below the order block or FVG) for long trades.
     - For short trades, place the stop loss above the confluence area.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of your account per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:3.
     - Optimize for higher ratios (e.g., 1:5 or 1:7) by refining entries using multi-timeframe analysis.
   - **Stop Loss Rules**:
     - Always place a stop loss to protect against adverse moves.
     - Adjust stop loss levels based on confluence areas and market structure.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
     - Used to define premium and discount zones within a price leg.
   - **Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps**:
     - Identify confluence areas for high-probability entries.
   - **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**:
     - Use higher timeframes (e.g., 15-minute) for directional bias and lower timeframes (e.g., 1-minute) for precise entries.

#### 6. **Step-by-Step Trade Execution**
   - **Step 1**: Identify the trend using external swing highs and lows on the higher timeframe.
   - **Step 2**: Draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the swing low to swing high.
   - **Step 3**: Locate confluence areas (order blocks or FVGs) within the discount zone.
   - **Step 4**: Wait for price to pull back into the confluence area on the higher timeframe.
   - **Step 5**: Switch to the lower timeframe and wait for a structural shift (e.g., bullish reversal for a long trade).
   - **Step 6**: Enter the trade at the confluence area with a stop loss below the confluence.
   - **Step 7**: Set take profit targets at the next external swing high (for bullish trades) or swing low (for bearish trades).
   - **Step 8**: Close 50% of the position at 5x risk and let the remaining position run to the full target.

#### 7. **Example Trade Setup**
   - **Bullish Trade**:
     - Higher timeframe (15-minute): Bullish structure with higher highs and higher lows.
     - Fibonacci retracement: Draw from swing low to swing high.
     - Confluence area: Order block or FVG within the discount zone.
     - Lower timeframe (1-minute): Wait for a bullish reversal (e.g., higher low and break of structure).
     - Entry: At the confluence area with a stop loss below the confluence.
     - Take Profit: Next external swing high.
   - **Bearish Trade**:
     - Higher timeframe (15-minute): Bearish structure with lower highs and lower lows.
     - Fibonacci retracement: Draw from swing high to swing low.
     - Confluence area: Order block or FVG within the premium zone.
     - Lower timeframe (1-minute): Wait for a bearish reversal (e.g., lower high and break of structure).
     - Entry: At the confluence area with a stop loss above the confluence.
     - Take Profit: Next external swing low.
