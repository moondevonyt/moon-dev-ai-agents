### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Indicator**: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
   - **Timeframe**: Use intraday data (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts).
   - **Asset**: Applicable to any liquid asset with sufficient volume (e.g., stocks, futures, or cryptocurrencies).
   - **Objective**: Identify mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities based on price deviations from VWAP.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Mean-Reversion Entry**:
     - Buy when the price crosses **below** the VWAP and then **reverts back above** it.
     - Sell when the price crosses **above** the VWAP and then **reverts back below** it.
   - **Trend-Following Entry**:
     - Buy when the price is **above** the VWAP and continues to move upward.
     - Sell when the price is **below** the VWAP and continues to move downward.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Fixed Profit Target**:
     - Set a profit target (e.g., 1% or 2% above/below the entry price).
   - **Fixed Stop Loss**:
     - Set a stop loss (e.g., 0.5% or 1% above/below the entry price).
   - **VWAP-Based Exit**:
     - Exit the trade if the price crosses back to the opposite side of the VWAP.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of the total account per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Use a fixed stop loss based on the volatility of the asset (e.g., ATR-based stop or percentage-based stop).
   - **Time-Based Exit**:
     - Close all positions at the end of the trading session to avoid overnight risk.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **VWAP**: Calculate the VWAP using the formula:
     \[
     \text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Price} \times \text{Volume})}{\sum \text{Volume}}
     \]
   - **Optional Indicators**:
     - Moving Averages (e.g., 9-period EMA) to confirm trends.
     - Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought/oversold conditions.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Data Quality**: Ensure high-quality intraday data with accurate volume and price information.
   - **Backtesting Period**: Test the strategy over multiple market conditions (e.g., trending, ranging, volatile).
   - **Optimization**: Fine-tune parameters (e.g., profit target, stop loss, and timeframe) based on backtesting results.

This strategy can be implemented in any backtesting platform that supports VWAP and intraday data. Adjust parameters as needed based on the asset and market conditions.
