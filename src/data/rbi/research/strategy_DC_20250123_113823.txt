### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting: VWAP + Volume & RSI

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**

     - **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: Used to identify the average price based on volume and price.
     - **Volume**: Used to confirm the strength of price movements.
     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Used to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **Timeframe**: Suitable for intraday trading (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute, or 1-hour charts).
   - **Asset**: Works best with liquid assets (e.g., stocks, forex, or crypto).
