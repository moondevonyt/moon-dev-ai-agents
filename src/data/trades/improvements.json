    "llm_analysis": "PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:\n- All trades entered long positions on meme coins (DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WIF, BONK, FLOKI, BOME) with consistently high RSI values (76\u201388), indicating overbought conditions.\n- High funding rates (1.4%\u20132.5%) across all trades, suggesting costly carry and potential overextension.\n- Weak momentum signals, with Momentum Z-Scores ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, below typical strong momentum thresholds.\n\nROOT CAUSES:\n- The strategy is chasing overextended moves by entering long positions when assets are already overbought (high RSI) and momentum is weak (low Z-Score), compounded by high funding costs that erode profits and often precede reversals. This results in entries at peaks, leading to quick drawdowns.\n\nRECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:\n1. Skip long entries if RSI > 75 to avoid overbought conditions and reduce reversal risk.\n2. Skip long entries if funding rate > 1.0% to minimize cost drag and avoid overextended markets.\n3. Require a minimum Momentum Z-Score > 1.0 for long entries to ensure stronger momentum confirmation.\n\nEXPECTED IMPACT:\n- These filters should reduce losses by preventing entries in overbought, high-cost environments, improving risk-adjusted returns through fewer false signals and lower funding expenses.",
